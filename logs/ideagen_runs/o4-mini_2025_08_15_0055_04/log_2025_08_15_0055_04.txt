    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"burgeoning field\" and \"magnetic sensing\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0. This measurement device thus performs a nonlocal parity\u2010phase readout of four remote magnetic fields in a single shot.\n\nVisualization:\n  \u2013 Pair source PS1 emits ancilla photons into modes A\u2090,B\u2090  \n  \u2013 Pair source PS2 emits ancilla photons into modes C\u2090,D\u2090  \n  \u2013 Inputs: sensor modes S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083,S\u2084 carry unknown phases.  \n  \u2013 Linear-optical interferometer mixes (S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083,S\u2084,A\u2090,B\u2090,C\u2090,D\u2090) via beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n  \u2013 Eight detectors resolve photon numbers and click patterns are mapped to the four GHZ outcomes.\n\nExample Pytheus config snippet:\n{\n  'description':      'Four\u2010qubit GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername':       'GHZ4_analyzer_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr':         0.01,\n  'edges_tried':      40,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          4,             # two pair sources = four ancilla photons\n  'num_pre':          1,\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary':        False,\n  'safe_hist':        True,\n  'samples':          20,\n  'single_emitters':  [],            # only probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [],         # no forbidden direct links\n  'heralding_out':    None,\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nPytheus will output the detailed beam\u2010splitter network that implements this GHZ measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"burgeoning field\" and \"magnetic sensing\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted Bell\u2010measurements and multi\u2010photon detection networks.\n\nStep 3: Pick (c).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has so far provided only two\u2010party analyzers (Bell, Yeo\u2013Chua, VAA/Mean King).

These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity.

This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133.

This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair. Two central swapping stations perform Bell\u2010state measurements on the two \u201chorizontal\u201d pairs A\u2032\u2013C\u2032 and B\u2032\u2013D\u2032.

This is just two independent entanglement\u2010swapping steps plus postprocessing\u2014no new nontrivial quantum network primitive or joint interference across four sensors. It reduces to trivial extension of back\u2010to\u2010back Bell swaps and classical arithmetic, lacking the integrated coherent multiplexing or higher-order invariant we require.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially two independent Bell swaps plus classical postprocessing, offering no new nonlocal quantum measurement beyond trivial entanglement swapping. To be novel, propose a genuine four-mode joint projector or nonclassical interference that cannot factor into separate two-link swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201cnoncommutativity witness via two-branch teleportation + SWAP test\u201d for distributed magnetometry.  \n\nProtocol sketch:\n1. A single input qubit \u03c8 enters node A.  \n2. At node B, it is teleported through a Bell measurement consuming one photon of pair PS\u2081; the other photon of PS\u2081 is kept locally at B.  \n3. The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4. Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Uses only back-to-back teleportation links + Bell analyzers + a SWAP-test interferometer\u2014entirely within probabilistic pair sources & linear optics.\n  b) Conceptually neat but reduces to four sequential entanglement swaps already covered.\n  c) Star-swap is just multiple back-to-back Bell swaps and trivial post-processing.\n\nStep 3: Choose (a).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n  No existing Pytheus experiment implements a two-branch teleportation network followed by a SWAP test to directly measure [U\u2081,U\u2082] of two unknown remote Faraday rotations.

A single input qubit \u03c8 enters node A.  \n2. At node B, it is teleported through a Bell measurement consuming one photon of pair PS\u2081; the other photon of PS\u2081 is kept locally at B.  \n3. The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4. Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6. The SWAP-test outcome statistics directly yield \u27e8\u03c8|U\u2081U\u2082U\u2081\u2020U\u2082\u2020|\u03c8\u27e9, i.e. a witness of [U\u2081,U\u2082]\u22600.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Pair sources PS\u2081\u2192(B1,B2), PS\u2082\u2192(C1,C2), PS\u2083\u2192(S1,S2)  \n\u2022 Single-photon source emits two identical qubits \u03c8 into modes X and Y.  \n\u2022 Teleportation link 1: Bell analyzer at B mixes \u03c8X & B1 \u2192 detectors D1\u2013D4.  \n\u2022 Teleportation link 2: Bell analyzer at C mixes intermediate mode & C1 \u2192 detectors D5\u2013D8.  \n\u2022 Branch reversal: second chain uses \u03c8Y & C2 at C then B2 at B.  \n\u2022 Final SWAP test: control ancilla S1,S2 + the two teleported outputs pass through a 4-mode linear network \u2192 detectors D9\u2013D16.  \n\nExample Pytheus config snippet:\n{\n  'description':      'Teleport-branches + SWAP test for noncommutativity of two Faraday rotations',\n  'foldername':       'comm_witness_tele_swap',\n  'edges_tried':      40,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          6,            # PS1, PS2 (4 photons) + PS3 (2 photons)\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples':          20,\n  'single_emitters':  [],           # all probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [          # forbid any PS directly linking nodes A\u2194C or B\u2194input\n    [0,2],[0,3],[1,4],[1,5]\n  ],\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nPytheus will output the beam-splitter + phase-shifter network realizing both the sequential teleportations and the controlled-SWAP. Once built, this device implements a fundamental distributed quantum sensor that doesn\u2019t just sum magnetic phases\u2014it directly witnesses the noncommutative nature of two spatially separated Faraday rotations.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea duplicates a previously proposed noncommutativity witness via entanglement-swapping. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally different network primitive or measurement (e.g. a non-trivial multi-copy projector or topological invariant) that cannot be reduced to sequential swaps and a SWAP-test.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts.

Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C.

It reads out the sum-phase around a loop\u2014a topological, gauge-invariant observable\u2014and uses only three pair sources, three Bell analyzers, and photon-number resolving detectors.\n\nStep 3: Select (c).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a closed-loop swapping network to measure a topological flux (\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C) mod 2\u03c0 via three simultaneous Bell measurements arranged in a cycle.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Three probabilistic photon-pair sources PS_AB\u2192(A\u2032,B\u2032), PS_BC\u2192(B\u2033,C\u2032), PS_CA\u2192(C\u2033,A\u2033).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three nodes A,B,C imprints an unknown Faraday phase onto one incoming photon.  \n  \u2022 Three Bell analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors) at nodes A,B,C consume the local rotated photon and the corresponding pair partner.  \n  \u2022 Number\u2010resolving detectors and no forbidden dynamic control.  \n  \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d used to forbid any unwanted direct sources.  \n  \u2022 Pytheus optimizes the fixed beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that implements those three Bell measurements in a loop.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose as target a \u201c3-cycle entanglement-swapping loop for topological magnetometry.\u201d  \nSetup:\n  \u2022 Pair source PS_AB emits photons into modes A\u2032,B\u2032.  \n  \u2022 PS_BC emits into B\u2033,C\u2032.  \n  \u2022 PS_CA emits into C\u2033,A\u2033.  \n  \u2022 Nodes A, B, C each imprint an unknown Faraday rotation UA, UB, UC on their respective modes A\u2032\u2192A, B\u2032\u2192B\u2033\u2192B, C\u2032\u2192C\u2033\u2192C, A\u2033\u2192A etc.  \n  \u2022 At each node X\u2208{A,B,C}, a Bell-state analyzer (linear optics + two ancilla detectors) performs entanglement-swapping between the rotated photon and the local ancilla from the corresponding PS.  \n  \u2022 The three simultaneous Bell measurements link the three nodes in a closed loop A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013A.  \n  \u2022 The joint click pattern across all ancilla detectors projects onto the two parity sectors corresponding to even vs. odd total number of \u201c1\u201d detections. These two outcomes are correlated with cos(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C) vs. sin(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C).  \n  \u2022 By histogramming the detection events, one directly measures the gauge-invariant sum of the three magnetic phases around the loop: \u03a6_loop=\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C mod 2\u03c0.\n\nExample Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  'description':      '3-cycle entanglement-swap loop for measuring \u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C',\n  'foldername':       'loop_magnetometry_3node',\n  'edges_tried':      40,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          6,            # three Bell analyzers \u00d7 two ancilla photons\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples':          15,\n  'single_emitters':  [],           # only probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [          # forbid any source other than AB, BC, CA\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,3]\n  ],\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nPytheus will optimize the detailed beam-splitter and phase-shift network that implements the three-Bell-swap loop. This device realizes a topological quantum magnetometer: it nonlocally measures the loop sum \u03a6_loop without ever transmitting a photon through all three sensors in sequence\u2014opening up new avenues for gauge-invariant, distributed magnetic sensing.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This mirrors the existing square\u2010loop Z\u2082-flux entanglement\u2010swap schemes (and triangular Berry-phase loops) without introducing a new non-factorizable projector or causal structure. To be novel at the PRL level, propose a target that cannot be decomposed into simultaneous Bell swaps around a closed loop\u2014e.g. a truly nonlocal three-mode projector, an anyonic holonomy beyond simple phase sum, or an indefinite-order network primitive.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "output": "We propose as a target the first **linear\u2010optic quantum SWITCH for distributed magnetometry**, i.e. a static interferometric network that implements a superposition of two unknown Faraday rotations UA, UB applied in both possible orders, and whose output click\u2010pattern directly witnesses [UA, UB]\u22600.\n\nExplanation  \nNodes A and B are spatially separated magnetometer stations. Each station imprints an unknown polarization rotation (Faraday phase) UA or UB on one arm of a fiber loop. We wish to build a single\u2010photon interferometer that routes the photon in a coherent superposition of \u201cA \u2192 B\u201d and \u201cB \u2192 A\u201d loops and then recombines to yield interference fringes sensitive to the commutator of the two rotations.  \n\nStructure (modes flow top\u2192bottom):  \n  \u2022 Single\u2010photon source emits into mode in.  \n  \u2022 BS1 (50\u223650) splits into path |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9.  \n  \u2022 Path |0\u27e9 enters loop L\u2081: first Faraday UA at station A, then a linking delay, then UB at B, then back to BS2.  \n  \u2022 Path |1\u27e9 enters loop L\u2082: first UB at B, then UA at A, then back to BS2.  \n  \u2022 BS2 recombines |0\u27e9,|1\u27e9; two number\u2010resolving detectors D0, D1 record interference.  \n\nBy suitably choosing the internal phase shifts on the two arms, the difference in click\u2010probabilities at D0 vs. D1 is proportional to Im\u2009Tr[\u03c1\u2009UAUBUA\u2020UB\u2020], i.e. a witness of the non\u2010Abelian character of the two local magnetic processes.  \n\nWhy this is novel  \n  \u2013 **Indefinite causal order in quantum optics**: Pytheus has never been asked to design a quantum switch.  \n  \u2013 **Network transformation, not state\u2010gen**: we only need a fixed static interferometer with two loops and two embedded unknown unitaries.  \n  \u2013 **Fundamental physics**: directly probes noncommutativity of spatially separated magnetic interactions without any feedback control.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible with Pytheus  \n  \u2013 Uses one single\u2010photon emitter (or heralded single photon) and purely linear optics (BS1, BS2, phase shifters), plus two fiber\u2010loops around UA and UB.  \n  \u2013 No dynamic feed\u2010forward; all elements are fixed beam splitters and delay\u2010loops \u2192 Pytheus can optimize the BS reflectivities and internal phases.  \n  \u2013 We simply set `loops=True` to allow the graph to contain two cycle\u2010edges.  \n  \u2013 One pair of number\u2010resolving detectors \u2192 ancilla\u2010free.  \n\nExample Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  'description':      'Quantum\u2010switch interferometer for UA,UB Faraday rotations',  \n  'foldername':       'magneto_switch',  \n  'loops':            True,          # permit the two cycle\u2010edges  \n  'single_emitters':  [0],           # one single\u2010photon emitter at node 0  \n  'nodes':            ['in','BS1','BS2','D0','D1'],  \n  'edges':            [               # BS1 splits in\u21920,1; loops connect back via UA,UB  \n     ['in','BS1'], ['BS1','UA-path0'], ['UA-path0','UB-path0'], ['UB-path0','BS2'],  \n     ['BS1','UB-path1'], ['UB-path1','UA-path1'], ['UA-path1','BS2'],  \n     ['BS2','D0'], ['BS2','D1']  \n  ],  \n  'num_anc':          0,             # no ancilla photons  \n  'removed_connections': [],  \n  'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nPytheus will optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter reflectivities and phase\u2010shifters (on the two arms) to maximize interference visibility between the two causal orders.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted Bell\u2010measurements and multi\u2010photon detection networks.\n\nStep 3: Pick (c).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has so far provided only two\u2010party analyzers (Bell, Yeo\u2013Chua, VAA/Mean King). A four\u2010qubit GHZ\u2010basis measurement network with ancillas sits outside the existing library.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Four incoming photonic qubits (unknown rotations from local magnetometers).  \n  \u2022 A small number of probabilistic photon-pair sources to furnish ancilla photons.  \n  \u2022 A linear-optic interferometer + photon-number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback, no cavities or resonances, no hyper/hybrid encodings.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6.

It reads out the sum-phase around a loop\u2014a topological, gauge-invariant observable\u2014and uses only three pair sources, three Bell analyzers, and photon-number resolving detectors.\n\nStep 3: Select (c).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a closed-loop swapping network to measure a topological flux (\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C) mod 2\u03c0 via three simultaneous Bell measurements arranged in a cycle.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Three probabilistic photon-pair sources PS_AB\u2192(A\u2032,B\u2032), PS_BC\u2192(B\u2033,C\u2032), PS_CA\u2192(C\u2033,A\u2033).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three nodes A,B,C imprints an unknown Faraday phase onto one incoming photon.  \n  \u2022 Three Bell analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors) at nodes A,B,C consume the local rotated photon and the corresponding pair partner.  \n  \u2022 Number\u2010resolving detectors and no forbidden dynamic control.  \n  \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d used to forbid any unwanted direct sources.  \n  \u2022 Pytheus optimizes the fixed beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that implements those three Bell measurements in a loop.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose as target a \u201c3-cycle entanglement-swapping loop for topological magnetometry.\u201d  \nSetup:\n  \u2022 Pair source PS_AB emits photons into modes A\u2032,B\u2032.  \n  \u2022 PS_BC emits into B\u2033,C\u2032.  \n  \u2022 PS_CA emits into C\u2033,A\u2033.  \n  \u2022 Nodes A, B, C each imprint an unknown Faraday rotation UA, UB, UC on their respective modes A\u2032\u2192A, B\u2032\u2192B\u2033\u2192B, C\u2032\u2192C\u2033\u2192C, A\u2033\u2192A etc.  \n  \u2022 At each node X\u2208{A,B,C}, a Bell-state analyzer (linear optics + two ancilla detectors) performs entanglement-swapping between the rotated photon and the local ancilla from the corresponding PS.  \n  \u2022 The three simultaneous Bell measurements link the three nodes in a closed loop A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013A.  \n  \u2022 The joint click pattern across all ancilla detectors projects onto the two parity sectors corresponding to even vs. odd total number of \u201c1\u201d detections.

This device realizes a topological quantum magnetometer: it nonlocally measures the loop sum \u03a6_loop without ever transmitting a photon through all three sensors in sequence\u2014opening up new avenues for gauge-invariant, distributed magnetic sensing.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This mirrors the existing square\u2010loop Z\u2082-flux entanglement\u2010swap schemes (and triangular Berry-phase loops) without introducing a new non-factorizable projector or causal structure. To be novel at the PRL level, propose a target that cannot be decomposed into simultaneous Bell swaps around a closed loop\u2014e.g. a truly nonlocal three-mode projector, an anyonic holonomy beyond simple phase sum, or an indefinite-order network primitive.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

We choose that there are three emitters that can send photons to Bob and Charlie ([2],[3],[4]) and three emitters that can send photons to Alice and Charlie ([5],[6],[7]).\\n\\nIn the context of single photon emitters, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes paths between the specified pairs of source and detector.\\nWe thus include all of these forbidden paths.\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc').

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"burgeoning field\" and \"magnetic sensing\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Uses only back-to-back teleportation links + Bell analyzers + a SWAP-test interferometer\u2014entirely within probabilistic pair sources & linear optics.\n  b) Conceptually neat but reduces to four sequential entanglement swaps already covered.\n  c) Star-swap is just multiple back-to-back Bell swaps and trivial post-processing.\n\nStep 3: Choose (a).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n  No existing Pytheus experiment implements a two-branch teleportation network followed by a SWAP test to directly measure [U\u2081,U\u2082] of two unknown remote Faraday rotations. This protocol elevates distributed magnetometry to sensing nonclassical, non-Abelian features of spatially separated magnetic processes.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility:\n  \u2013 Uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources for teleportation links.  \n  \u2013 Two Bell analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors) at the intermediate nodes.  \n  \u2013 A final interferometric SWAP-test network (standard beam\u2010splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper/hybrid encoding.  \n  \u2013 \u201cUnknown unitaries\u201d U\u2081,U\u2082 (Faraday rotations) sit outside the optimization; Pytheus only designs the fixed network around them.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose as a target a \u201cnoncommutativity witness via two-branch teleportation + SWAP test\u201d for distributed magnetometry.  \n\nProtocol sketch:\n1. A single input qubit \u03c8 enters node A.  \n2. At node B, it is teleported through a Bell measurement consuming one photon of pair PS\u2081; the other photon of PS\u2081 is kept locally at B.  \n3. The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4. Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6. The SWAP-test outcome statistics directly yield \u27e8\u03c8|U\u2081U\u2082U\u2081\u2020U\u2082\u2020|\u03c8\u27e9, i.e. a witness of [U\u2081,U\u2082]\u22600.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Pair sources PS\u2081\u2192(B1,B2), PS\u2082\u2192(C1,C2), PS\u2083\u2192(S1,S2)  \n\u2022 Single-photon source emits two identical qubits \u03c8 into modes X and Y.  \n\u2022 Teleportation link 1: Bell analyzer at B mixes \u03c8X & B1 \u2192 detectors D1\u2013D4.  \n\u2022 Teleportation link 2: Bell analyzer at C mixes intermediate mode & C1 \u2192 detectors D5\u2013D8.  \n\u2022 Branch reversal: second chain uses \u03c8Y & C2 at C then B2 at B.  \n\u2022 Final SWAP test: control ancilla S1,S2 + the two teleported outputs pass through a 4-mode linear network \u2192 detectors D9\u2013D16.  \n\nExample Pytheus config snippet:\n{\n  'description':      'Teleport-branches + SWAP test for noncommutativity of two Faraday rotations',\n  'foldername':       'comm_witness_tele_swap',\n  'edges_tried':      40,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          6,            # PS1, PS2 (4 photons) + PS3 (2 photons)\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples':          20,\n  'single_emitters':  [],           # all probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [          # forbid any PS directly linking nodes A\u2194C or B\u2194input\n    [0,2],[0,3],[1,4],[1,5]\n  ],\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nPytheus will output the beam-splitter + phase-shifter network realizing both the sequential teleportations and the controlled-SWAP. Once built, this device implements a fundamental distributed quantum sensor that doesn\u2019t just sum magnetic phases\u2014it directly witnesses the noncommutative nature of two spatially separated Faraday rotations.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea duplicates a previously proposed noncommutativity witness via entanglement-swapping.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit.

Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node.

By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward.

By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step.

By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

This is just two independent entanglement\u2010swapping steps plus postprocessing\u2014no new nontrivial quantum network primitive or joint interference across four sensors. It reduces to trivial extension of back\u2010to\u2010back Bell swaps and classical arithmetic, lacking the integrated coherent multiplexing or higher-order invariant we require.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially two independent Bell swaps plus classical postprocessing, offering no new nonlocal quantum measurement beyond trivial entanglement swapping. To be novel, propose a genuine four-mode joint projector or nonclassical interference that cannot factor into separate two-link swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201cnoncommutativity witness via two-branch teleportation + SWAP test\u201d for distributed magnetometry.  \n\nProtocol sketch:\n1. A single input qubit \u03c8 enters node A.  \n2. At node B, it is teleported through a Bell measurement consuming one photon of pair PS\u2081; the other photon of PS\u2081 is kept locally at B.  \n3. The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted Bell\u2010measurements and multi\u2010photon detection networks.\n\nStep 3: Pick (c).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has so far provided only two\u2010party analyzers (Bell, Yeo\u2013Chua, VAA/Mean King). A four\u2010qubit GHZ\u2010basis measurement network with ancillas sits outside the existing library.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Four incoming photonic qubits (unknown rotations from local magnetometers).  \n  \u2022 A small number of probabilistic photon-pair sources to furnish ancilla photons.  \n  \u2022 A linear-optic interferometer + photon-number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback, no cavities or resonances, no hyper/hybrid encodings.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6.

Once built, this device implements a fundamental distributed quantum sensor that doesn\u2019t just sum magnetic phases\u2014it directly witnesses the noncommutative nature of two spatially separated Faraday rotations.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea duplicates a previously proposed noncommutativity witness via entanglement-swapping. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally different network primitive or measurement (e.g. a non-trivial multi-copy projector or topological invariant) that cannot be reduced to sequential swaps and a SWAP-test.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition.

By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"burgeoning field\" and \"magnetic sensing\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.

The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4. Meanwhile, a copy of \u03c8 (prepared by an identical single-photon source) is sent in parallel through nodes C then B, picking up phases U\u2082 then U\u2081, via two Bell teleportations consuming the same PS\u2081 and PS\u2082 resources (but on the complementary modes).  \n5. The two teleported outputs (one carrying U\u2081U\u2082\u03c8, the other U\u2082U\u2081\u03c8) are routed into a SWAP-test interferometer (controlled-SWAP implemented with one extra ancilla Bell pair PS\u2083) and a final photon-number-resolving measurement.  \n6.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences.

By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Two-Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network\n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose and analyze a one-shot multi-hop entanglement swap that compresses two sequential Bell-pair swaps across the target network A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D into a single four-photon joint interference measurement. By heralding one of 16 detector click patterns at a fixed 4-mode interferometer and applying local Pauli corrections, end nodes A and D are projected directly into a maximally entangled Bell state without intermediate feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Simulation of a Two-Qubit Superradiant Amplitude-Damping Channel via Static Entanglement-Swapping\n\nMini-abstract: We design a static linear-optics network of N \u201ccollision\u201d modules\u2014each using a probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla, beam-splitter partial swaps and Bell measurements\u2014to implement the Kraus operators K\u2080=I\u2212(\u03b3\u0394t/2)J\u208aJ\u208b and K\u2081=\u221a(\u03b3\u0394t)J\u208b (with J\u208b=\u03c3\u208b^(1)+\u03c3\u208b^(2)), thereby simulating the master equation \u2202\u209c\u03c1=\u03b3\u2009D[J\u208b]\u2009\u03c1 for two-qubit collective amplitude damping. The experiment\u2019s target is the Choi vector of the N-step collective amplitude-damping channel, directly represented in PyTHEUS\u2019s abstract state language across system inputs, outputs and ancilla outcomes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0. This measurement device thus performs a nonlocal parity\u2010phase readout of four remote magnetic fields in a single shot.\n\nVisualization:\n  \u2013 Pair source PS1 emits ancilla photons into modes A\u2090,B\u2090  \n  \u2013 Pair source PS2 emits ancilla photons into modes C\u2090,D\u2090  \n  \u2013 Inputs: sensor modes S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083,S\u2084 carry unknown phases.  \n  \u2013 Linear-optical interferometer mixes (S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083,S\u2084,A\u2090,B\u2090,C\u2090,D\u2090) via beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n  \u2013 Eight detectors resolve photon numbers and click patterns are mapped to the four GHZ outcomes.\n\nExample Pytheus config snippet:\n{\n  'description':      'Four\u2010qubit GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername':       'GHZ4_analyzer_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr':         0.01,\n  'edges_tried':      40,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          4,             # two pair sources = four ancilla photons\n  'num_pre':          1,\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary':        False,\n  'safe_hist':        True,\n  'samples':          20,\n  'single_emitters':  [],            # only probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [],         # no forbidden direct links\n  'heralding_out':    None,\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nPytheus will output the detailed beam\u2010splitter network that implements this GHZ measurement.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot.

To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

It reduces to trivial extension of back\u2010to\u2010back Bell swaps and classical arithmetic, lacking the integrated coherent multiplexing or higher-order invariant we require.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially two independent Bell swaps plus classical postprocessing, offering no new nonlocal quantum measurement beyond trivial entanglement swapping.

A single input qubit \u03c8 enters node A.  \n2. At node B, it is teleported through a Bell measurement consuming one photon of pair PS\u2081; the other photon of PS\u2081 is kept locally at B.  \n3. The teleported qubit picks up an unknown Faraday phase U\u2081 at magnetometer B, then is teleported again at C via Bell measurement on a second pair PS\u2082.  \n4.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed three\u2010link teleportation chain that coherently sums three local Faraday phases via sequential Bell swaps is essentially the same as the \u201cCascaded Entanglement\u2010Swapping Network for Distributed Sum\u2010Phase Quantum Sensing\u201d already in the ensemble. That scheme fuses three phase-imprinted photons via two entanglement swaps to yield an output with phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083 for distributed magnetometry. This new idea offers no fundamentally new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that known cascaded\u2010swap sensor, so it fails our novelty bar.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as target a \u201cfour\u2010party GHZ\u2010basis analyzer for distributed magnetometry.\u201d In practice, four separate magnetometer stations imprint unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phases \u03c6\u2081\u2026\u03c6\u2084 onto four photonic qubits. These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. The network is optimized (by Pytheus) to discriminate the four orthogonal GHZ\u2010basis states\n\n  |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0000\u27e9 \u00b1 |1111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n  |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9 = (|0011\u27e9 \u00b1 |1100\u27e9)/\u221a2\n\nso that the joint detection outcome reveals directly the total phase sum \u00b1(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083+\u03c6\u2084) mod\u20092\u03c0.

Both perform a nonlocal parity\u2013phase readout of four local rotation phases in one shot. Recasting the same sum-phase sensing via a GHZ projector does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement capability beyond that square-loop swap interferometer.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal essentially duplicates the already\u2010present entanglement\u2010swapping square-loop Z\u2082-flux detection scheme. To be novel you must go beyond mere sum\u2010phase readout\u2014e.g. propose a new multi-party phase invariant, a higher-order correlation measurement, or a nontrivial topology or causal structure not covered by back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose as a target a \u201c2\u00d72 entanglement\u2010swapping grid for distributed magnetometry.\u201d  \nFour distant magnetometer nodes A, B, C, D each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase \u03c6A\u2026\u03c6D onto one photon of a locally generated Bell pair.

This is just two independent entanglement\u2010swapping steps plus postprocessing\u2014no new nontrivial quantum network primitive or joint interference across four sensors. It reduces to trivial extension of back\u2010to\u2010back Bell swaps and classical arithmetic, lacking the integrated coherent multiplexing or higher-order invariant we require.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially two independent Bell swaps plus classical postprocessing, offering no new nonlocal quantum measurement beyond trivial entanglement swapping.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment. To be novel, you must propose a target going beyond simple multi-hop teleportation of summed phases\u2014e.g. a new nontrivial network topology, higher\u2010order invariant, or a protocol that cannot be decomposed into back-to-back Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "output": "We propose as a Pytheus target the design of a \u201c3-qubit GHZ-basis analyzer\u201d to serve as the heart of a measurement-device-independent (MDI) three-node magnetometer.  \n\nContext & Why It\u2019s New  \n\u2022 In MDI\u2010QKD one uses a central Bell-state measurement to correlate two remote qubits without trusting the detector.  Here we generalize to three remote magnetometers: A, B, and C each imprint an unknown Faraday\u2010rotation phase UA,UB,UC on a single-photon probe.  All three photons are sent to a central, untrusted station.  Instead of a Bell measurement, we demand a full 3-qubit GHZ analyzer that unambiguously discriminates the eight orthogonal GHZ basis states  \n    |GHZ\u00b1\u27e9 = (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n    |GHZ\u2032\u00b1\u27e9= (|001\u27e9\u00b1|110\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n    |GHZ\u2033\u00b1\u27e9= (|010\u27e9\u00b1|101\u27e9)/\u221a2  \n    |GHZ\u2034\u00b1\u27e9= (|011\u27e9\u00b1|100\u27e9)/\u221a2.  \n\u2022 This is the first proposal for a static linear-optical network (no feedback, no cavities) that implements a full three-photon GHZ measurement with only probabilistic pair sources, beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n\nSensing Application  \n\u2022 The observed GHZ outcome probabilities P(\u03c0) depend on the total phase sum \u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C and on higher-order correlations.  In particular the \u201c+\u201d vs \u201c\u2013\u201d branches of each basis give direct access to cos(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C) and sin(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C).  By classical post\u2010processing one extracts both the global sum of the three fields and genuine three-way correlations\u2014even though the detector is untrusted!  \n\nVisualization  \n  1) Three single-photon probes (modes S_A,S_B,S_C) each pass through UA,UB,UC at nodes A,B,C.  \n  2) Two probabilistic photon-pair sources PS1\u2192(a1,a2), PS2\u2192(b1,b2) furnish four ancilla photons.  \n  3) A seven-mode linear-optical interferometer mixes {S_A,S_B,S_C,a1,b1,a2,b2} via beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n  4) Seven photon-number-resolving detectors read out one of the eight GHZ-basis signatures.  \n\nExample Pytheus Config Sketch  \n{  \n  'description':      '3-qubit GHZ-basis analyzer for MDI three-node magnetometry',  \n  'foldername':       'GHZ3_analyzer_MDI_magneto',  \n  'edges_tried':      40,  \n  'ftol':             1e-06,  \n  'loss_func':        'cr',  \n  'num_anc':          4,            # two pair sources \u2192 four ancilla photons  \n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',  \n  'samples':          20,  \n  'single_emitters':  [],           # only probabilistic pair sources  \n  'removed_connections': [],        # no forbidden links  \n  'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nWhy Pytheus Can Do It  \n\u2022 Pytheus can optimize exactly this kind of static, ancilla-assisted multi-photon measurement network.  \n\u2022 All elements (probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, photon-number-resolving detectors) are within its toolbox.  \n\nImpact & Generalizations  \n\u2022 Beyond three nodes one can extend to an N-photon GHZ analyzer for larger MDI magnetometry networks.  \n\u2022 Different GHZ subspaces yield access to multi-node correlations of arbitrary order.  \n\u2022 This opens a new class of measurement-device-independent quantum sensors for distributed magnetic fields."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"burgeoning field\" and \"magnetic sensing\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources.

Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

These four photons are then fed into a single linear-optical network, together with a small number of ancilla photons drawn from two probabilistic pair sources, and measured with photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.

    "output": "We propose a new family of \u201centanglement\u2010swapping process\u2010fidelity sensors\u201d that directly measure the overlap (process fidelity) between two unknown Faraday\u2010rotation unitaries UA,UB imprinted on photons at remote magnetometer stations A and B\u2014without ever performing local tomography.  This network can be generalized to N stations (measuring multiple mutual fidelities) or to higher\u2010dimensional channels, opening a rich toolbox of \u201cnetworked process\u2010tomography\u201d protocols.\n\n\u2014 Protocol sketch for A vs. B fidelity measurement \u2014  \n1) Station A uses a probabilistic pair source PS\u2081 to produce photons in modes A\u2081,A\u2082. Mode A\u2081 passes through the unknown Faraday rotation UA; A\u2082 is held as an ancilla.  \n2) Station B uses an independent pair source PS\u2082 to produce modes B\u2081,B\u2082. B\u2081 passes through UB; B\u2082 is held.  \n3) At a central station we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (BSM\u2081) on A\u2082 and B\u2081.  By entanglement swapping this teleports UB onto A\u2081, producing effectively UA\u2218UB on mode A\u2081.  \n4) Immediately thereafter we perform a second Bell\u2010state measurement (BSM\u2082) on A\u2081 and a fresh ancilla from PS\u2083.  The probability of obtaining the \u201csame\u2010Bell\u201d outcome is proportional to |Tr[UA\u2009\u2020\u2009UB]|\u00b2.  \n5) By recording the frequency of that heralded outcome we directly estimate the process fidelity F=|Tr[UA\u2020UB]|/2.  \n\nThis static 3\u2010BSM network uses only three probabilistic pair sources and two chained Bell analyzers (total ancilla detectors ~8), no dynamic feed-forward, no cavities or hybrid encodings\u2014all within Pytheus\u2019s toolbox.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n\n  Emitter & PS\u2081:    [A\u2081]\u2014UA\u2192 \u25cf           [A\u2082]  \n  PS\u2082:              [B\u2081]\u2014UB\u2192 \u25cf           [B\u2082]  \n  BSM\u2081 Analyzer:    mixes A\u2082,B\u2081 \u2192 detectors D1\u2013D4  \n  \u2192 teleported mode T=A\u2081\u2032 now carries UA\u2218UB  \n  PS\u2083:              [C\u2081],[C\u2082] (fresh ancillas)  \n  BSM\u2082 Analyzer:    mixes T,C\u2081 \u2192 detectors D5\u2013D8  \n\nKey fields for Pytheus config:\n\n{\n 'description':      'Entanglement\u2010swap network for process\u2010fidelity of two Faraday rotations',\n 'foldername':       'process_fidelity_magneto',\n 'bulk_thr':         0.01,\n 'edges_tried':      30,\n 'ftol':             1e-06,\n 'loss_func':        'cr',\n 'num_anc':          6,            # PS1,PS2 (4 photons) + PS3 (2 photons)\n 'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n 'samples':          20,\n 'single_emitters':  [],           # only probabilistic pair sources\n 'removed_connections': [           # forbid any pair source spanning both A and B outputs\n   [0,3],[1,2]\n ],\n 'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\u2014 Why this is novel \u2014  \nNo existing Pytheus experiments target *process* rather than *state* fidelity between two unknown rotations in a distributed network.  This scheme elevates entanglement swapping into a direct *channel-overlap* sensor.  It can be immediately generalized to measure pairwise fidelities among N nodes (a complete graph of channel\u2010overlap sensors), or to discriminate among multiple candidate rotations by networked hypothesis tests.  It thus opens a broad, modular toolkit of distributed *process tomography* and *multi-hypothesis magnetometry* with linear optics and entanglement swapping.\n\n\u2014 Why Pytheus can implement it \u2014  \nAll components\u2014probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, static linear-optical Bell analyzers, photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014are within Pytheus\u2019s capability.  No dynamic feedback or exotic encoding is required; the unknown Faraday rotations appear simply as abstract 2\u00d72 unitaries on specific modes.  Pytheus will optimize the interferometric mixing that realizes the two chained Bell measurements, yielding a fully static network for direct, heralded process\u2010fidelity sensing."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

We wish to place these three rotations in a coherent superposition of all 3!\u2009=\u20096 possible orders and read out both the fully symmetrized phase sum and genuine three\u2010body noncommutativity invariants in one measurement.\n\nProtocol sketch:\n1. Prepare a single\u2010photon probe in mode T.  \n2. Use two probabilistic pair sources (PS\u2081, PS\u2082) plus Bell\u2010analyzer 1 (linear optics + ancilla detectors D1\u2013D4) to entangle T with a 6-dimensional \u201ccontrol register\u201d in the uniform superposition of all permutations \u03c0\u2208S\u2083.  \n3.

To be novel, you must propose a measurement or network primitive that cannot be reduced to a higher-N generalization of the same SWITCH idea\u2014e.g. a genuinely new multi-copy projector, topological invariant, or causal structure not captured by existing 2- or 3-operation SWITCH protocols.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Emerging entanglement on network histories\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Overcoming Noise Limitations in QKD with Quantum Privacy Amplification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Obstacle: need to specify Bell analyzers and forbid non\u2010neighbouring sources via removed_connections\u2014Pytheus can handle that.\n  b) Similar to entanglement swapping examples but adds four nodes\u2014less novel.\n  c) Too close to GHZ/state\u2010gen, and Pytheus doesn\u2019t handle hyper\u2010entanglement or GHZ state generation directly.\nStep 3: Pick (a) \u2013 the teleportation\u2010chain magnetometry network.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus example has optimized a multi\u2010link teleportation chain as a sensing bus, and it directly combines teleportation with local phase encoding (magnetic\u2010field sensing).\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses probabilistic pair sources, Bell\u2010state analyzers (linear optics + ancilla detectors), and removed_connections to forbid unwanted sources. The local Faraday rotations are treated as abstract unknown unitaries and do not enter Pytheus\u2019s optimization. \nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nExplanation:\nWe propose designing a three\u2010link linear\u2010optical quantum teleportation network which teleports an unknown photonic qubit from node A to node D via two intermediate nodes B and C. Between each link the traveling qubit accrues an unknown phase rotation (modeling a Faraday rotation in a magnetometer at that node). After three teleportations the output qubit at D carries the sum of the three local magnetic phases. This modular \u201cteleportation bus\u201d can serve as a backbone for distributed quantum magnetometry: by exposing each link to a local magnetic field (Faraday rotator), one coherently sums field\u2010induced phases over long distances without physically transmitting the photon through all nodes.\n\nVisualization:\nemitters and pair sources:  \n  PS1 \u2192 modes [A_in, B1]  \n  PS2 \u2192 modes [B2, C1]  \n  PS3 \u2192 modes [C2, D_out]  \nBell analyzers at B and C: each consumes the incoming qubit plus one photon from the local pair source, with their four ancilla detectors.  \nForbidden direct sources (removed_connections) ensure no PS bridges non\u2010adjacent nodes.  \nHeralding at D_out signals successful end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation.\n\nConfig:\n{\n  'description': 'Three\u2010link quantum teleportation chain for distributed magnetometry',\n  'foldername': 'teleport_chain_3nodes_magneto',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                   # two Bell analyzers, two ancilla detectors each\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'single_emitters': [],         # we use probabilistic pair sources only\n  'removed_connections': [       # forbid any source linking non\u2010neighbour modes\n    [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5],\n    [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]\n  ],\n  'heralding_out': 5,            # mode 5 is the final output detector D_out\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the previously suggested cascaded entanglement\u2010swapping sum\u2010phase sensing experiment.

It uses only probabilistic pair sources, Bell analyzers, static linear optics, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nStep 3: Choose (c).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n  \u2022 First proposal to use a multi\u2010node entanglement\u2010swapping network as a heralded unambiguous discriminator of two possible spatially separated Faraday\u2010rotation patterns.  \n  \u2022 Goes beyond simple phase\u2010sum readouts to perform multi\u2010hypothesis channel discrimination in a distributed sensor network.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility:\n  \u2022 Uses two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (PS\u2081, PS\u2082) at nodes A and B.  \n  \u2022 At each node the \u201csignal\u201d photon picks up an unknown rotation UA or UB (either +\u03b8 or \u2212\u03b8).  \n  \u2022 A central Bell\u2010state analyzer (linear optics + four ancilla detectors) entanglement\u2010swaps the two rotated photons.  \n  \u2022 Depending on the click pattern the network unambiguously heralds \u201csame sign\u201d vs. \u201copposite sign\u201d with some finite success probability.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper/hybrid encoding\u2014only static linear optics and number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose as target a \u201cheralded unambiguous channel\u2010discrimination network for two remote magnetometers.\u201d Nodes A and B each imprint either +\u03b8 or \u2212\u03b8 Faraday rotations UA,UB on a passing photon. The task is to unambiguously decide whether UA=UB (same\u2010sign fields) or UA=UB\u2020 (opposite\u2010sign fields), with nonzero success probability and guaranteed error-free conclusions when heralded.\n\nProtocol sketch:\n  1. PS\u2081 at A emits a Bell pair in modes (A\u2081,A\u2082); mode A\u2081 goes through the unknown rotation UA, mode A\u2082 is kept as a local ancilla.  \n  2. PS\u2082 at B emits a Bell pair in modes (B\u2081,B\u2082); mode B\u2081 goes through the unknown rotation UB, mode B\u2082 is kept.  \n  3. At a central station, modes A\u2081 and B\u2081 are fed into a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010state analyzer (mixing them on beam splitters + phase shifters), alongside two ancilla photons from A\u2082,B\u2082.  \n  4. Photon\u2010number resolving detectors record click patterns across four ancilla ports. Certain click patterns occur only if the two rotations commute (UA=UB) or anticommute (UA=UB\u2020).  \n  5. Whenever a distinguishing pattern is observed, the network heralds \u201csame sign\u201d vs. \u201copposite sign\u201d with zero error. Otherwise, the run is inconclusive.\n\nVisualization:\n  \u2013 PS\u2081\u2192(A\u2081,A\u2082)  \n  \u2013 PS\u2082\u2192(B\u2081,B\u2082)  \n  \u2013 Unknown rotations: A\u2081\u2192UA(A\u2081), B\u2081\u2192UB(B\u2081)  \n  \u2013 Bell analyzer: mix UA(A\u2081),UB(B\u2081),A\u2082,B\u2082 through a 4-mode interferometer  \n  \u2013 Detectors D1\u2013D4 resolve photon numbers  \n\nExample Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  'description':      'Unambiguous discrimination of same vs. opposite Faraday rotations',\n  'foldername':       'magneto_channel_discrim',\n  'edges_tried':      30,\n  'ftol':             1e-06,\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'num_anc':          4,            # ancillas A\u2082,B\u2082 + analyzer resources\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples':          20,\n  'single_emitters':  [],           # only probabilistic pair sources\n  'removed_connections': [],        # no forbidden links beyond the prescribed pairs\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nWhy it\u2019s novel?\n  \u2022 No Pytheus experiment has targeted unambiguous channel discrimination of unknown unitaries across two nodes via entanglement swapping.  \n  \u2022 It elevates distributed magnetometry from phase estimation to multi-hypothesis sensing with heralded, error\u2010free decisions.\n\nWhy Pytheus can do it:\n  \u2022 All elements\u2014probabilistic photon-pair sources, linear-optical Bell analyzers, static beam-splitters and phase-shifters, photon-number resolving detectors\u2014are within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  \u2022 \u201cUnknown rotations\u201d UA,UB serve simply as abstract unitaries in the network; Pytheus only designs the surrounding interferometer.\n\nThis target opens the way to a new class of quantum\u2010networked, heralded channel discrimination experiments for magnetic sensing, and can be further generalized to N nodes and multiple\u2010hypothesis pattern classification in future papers.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is essentially a trivial adaptation of the existing static LOQC channel\u2010discrimination scheme to \u00b1\u03b8 Faraday rotations.

    "output": "We propose as a target a \u201cquantum-controlled superposition of entanglement-swapping graphs\u201d for differential magnetometry across four remote Faraday-rotation sensors.  In essence, you coherently superpose two distinct swap-network topologies\u2014(A\u2194B & C\u2194D) versus (A\u2194C & B\u2194D)\u2014and read out their interference, which directly encodes the difference of two phase\u2010sums, e.g.  \n    \u0394\u03c6 = (\u03c6_A+\u03c6_B) \u2013 (\u03c6_C+\u03c6_D).\n\nWhy this is novel:  \n  \u2022 No Pytheus example so far places two different swap-graphs in coherent superposition.  It goes beyond a single swap\u2010chain or loop: it harnesses a genuinely new network primitive\u2014superposition of connectivity\u2014to extract linear combinations of remote magnetic phases.  \n  \u2022 Independently of implementation, it defines a whole new class of \u201cgraph-superposition\u201d quantum networks that can be generalized to N-node sensor arrays and more complex network codes.\n\nWhy Pytheus can do it:  \n  \u2022 Uses only 4 single-photon emitters as the four sensor probes (each picks up an unknown Faraday phase \u03c6_X).  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic photon-pair sources supply the ancilla photons for the two Bell analyzers (one analyzer for the AB\u2013CD pattern, one for the AC\u2013BD pattern).  \n  \u2022 A single ancilla \u201ccontrol photon\u201d prepared in |+\u27e9 and injected into a small interferometer coherently routes the four sensor photons through one pair of Bell analyzers or the other.  \n  \u2022 Two static linear-optical Bell analyzers (beam-splitters + phase shifters + number-resolving detectors) perform the swapping for each pattern.  \n  \u2022 A final interference on the control photon\u2019s two output ports reads out the relative phase between the two swap patterns, which equals \u0394\u03c6.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, no cavities, no hyper/hybrid encoding\u2014entirely within Pytheus\u2019s toolkit of probabilistic pair sources, single emitters, linear optics, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):  \n1) Four single-photon emitters E_A,E_B,E_C,E_D produce modes A,B,C,D, each acquiring \u03c6_A\u2026\u03c6_D in local Faraday rotators.  \n2) An ancilla photon in |+\u27e9 control mode splits on a 50:50 beam splitter into \u201cpath\u20090\u201d and \u201cpath\u20091.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Path\u20090 routes (A,B,C,D) through Bell analyzer BA (ancillas from PS\u2081) that swaps A\u2194B and C\u2194D.  \n   \u2013 Path\u20091 routes them through Bell analyzer BB (ancillas from PS\u2082) that swaps A\u2194C and B\u2194D.  \n3) The two control arms recombine on a second 50:50 beam splitter; its two detectors herald constructive vs. destructive interference, giving \u27e8e^{i\u0394\u03c6}\u27e9.  \n4) Four number-resolving detectors on BA and BB register the successful swaps\u2014but you post-select on those runs and read out the control-photon clicks.\n\nExample Pytheus config sketch:  \n{  \n  'description':      'Graph-superposition entanglement swapping for \u0394\u03c6=(\u03c6A+\u03c6B)\u2212(\u03c6C+\u03c6D)',  \n  'foldername':       'swap_superposition_magneto',  \n  'single_emitters':  [0,1,2,3],           # these emit modes A,B,C,D  \n  'num_anc':          4,                   # two Bell analyzers \u00d7 2 ancilla photons  \n  'edges_tried':      40,  \n  'ftol':             1e-06,  \n  'loss_func':        'cr',  \n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',  \n  'samples':          20,  \n  'removed_connections': [                 # forbid any stray ancilla\u2192sensor paths  \n     [0,4],[0,5],[1,6],[1,7],[2,4],[2,5],[3,6],[3,7]  \n  ],  \n  'number_resolving': True  \n}\n\nOnce Pytheus returns the optimized beam-splitter/phase-shifter network, you will have a fully static linear-optical device that\u2014in a single heralded shot\u2014measures \u0394\u03c6 between two different pairwise sums of four remote Faraday phases.  This \u201cgraph-superposition\u201d paradigm can be extended to more nodes and more complex network codes, opening an entirely new avenue in distributed quantum magnetometry and network-coding of sensor data."
