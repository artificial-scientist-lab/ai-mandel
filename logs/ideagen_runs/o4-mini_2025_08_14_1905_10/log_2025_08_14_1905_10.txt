    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought:  \nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201crydberg atom array\u201d and \u201centangled quantum state\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible target that emphasizes quantum networks rather than mere state generation:  \n  1) A chain of entanglement\u2010swapping steps linking four Rydberg\u2010array nodes (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D), all embedded in a single linear\u2010optical circuit, to entangle the end nodes A and D.  \n  2) A star\u2010network distribution: each of N Rydberg nodes emits photons that meet at a central station to implement a multi\u2010party swap protocol, distributing entanglement in a \u201chub\u2010and\u2010spoke\u201d fashion.  \n  3) A post\u2010selected multi-hop teleportation circuit: an unknown qubit prepared at node A is teleported through nodes B and C to arrive at node D, all via a single integrated beam\u2010splitter/measurement network.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1) The 4-node chained swap (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) is not in the existing list. It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks."

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D.

We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is effectively the same primitive as an entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch or indefinite\u2010order entanglement swapping\u2014heralding A\u2013D Bell correlations via a coherent superposition of mediation through B or C. Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals. There\u2019s no new resource or mechanism beyond known optical quantum\u2010switch experiments, so it lacks the novelty needed for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cThree-Branch Coherent Entanglement Swap via Rydberg-Array Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg sites by eight single-photon emitters:\n  Emitters: [0:A], [1:B\u2081], [2:B\u2082], [3:C\u2081], [4:C\u2082], [5:D\u2081], [6:D\u2082], [7:E].\n\nGoal:\nPost-selectively project the two output modes at detectors 0 and 7 into the Bell state |00>+|11> via a coherent superposition of swapping through mediators B, C, or D.\n\nConfiguration:\n  \u2022 num_pre: 1  \n  \u2022 num_anc (ancilla detectors): 6  \n  \u2022 single_emitters: [0\u20267]  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [1,2,3,4,5,6]  // detectors for mediator photons  \n  \u2022 out_nodes (Bell outputs): [0,7]  \n\nRemoved connections:\n  // A (emitter 0) and E (emitter 7) only connect to their output detectors 0 and 7\n  Forbid edges [[0,i],[7,i]] for i in [1..6]\n  // Mediator emitters B\u2081\u2013D\u2082 ([1..6]) only connect to ancilla detectors [1..6], not to outputs:\n  Forbid edges [[j,0],[j,7]] for j in [1..6]\n\nTarget quantum:\n  // Conditional on exactly one click per mediator pair (post-selecting six ancilla clicks,  \n  // two from each branch combined on the internal interferometer), the state at detectors 0 and 7 is\n  ['00','11']\n\nRemarks:\n  \u2022 The internal linear-optical network must erase the path-label (which mediator) by mixing all six mediator photons in a 3-port tritter-like arrangement, so that the final heralding cannot distinguish B vs C vs D.\n  \u2022 Upon the heralding pattern (six clicks), detectors 0 and 7 collapse into a maximally entangled qubit pair.\n  \u2022 This fully static circuit generalizes to N-branch superpositions by adding more mediator emitter pairs and extending the mixing network, yielding a family of \u201cmulti-branch entanglement-switch\u201d modules for Rydberg-based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While extending entanglement swapping to three parallel mediator branches may sound like a longer chain, it is essentially the same primitive as the \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four\u2010Node Photonic Circuit,\u201d both of which already realize coherent superpositions of multiple swap channels in one shot. Simply going from two to three branches\u2014even with Rydberg-array emitters\u2014does not introduce a qualitatively new resource or protocol, but is a trivial generalization of known multi\u2010path swap schemes.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of superposing multiple entanglement-swap paths already demonstrated by the \u201cEntanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps\u201d experiments. To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D. These emitters feed into a single static linear-optical network and are measured by six detectors: two \u201cclient\u201d outputs (labelled 0,1) and four \u201cancilla\u201d detectors (labelled 2\u20135).\n\nBy post-selecting on which pair of ancilla detectors clicks, the same hardware projects a different pair of emitters into a Bell state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins.

This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals. There\u2019s no new resource or mechanism beyond known optical quantum\u2010switch experiments, so it lacks the novelty needed for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cThree-Branch Coherent Entanglement Swap via Rydberg-Array Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg sites by eight single-photon emitters:\n  Emitters: [0:A], [1:B\u2081], [2:B\u2082], [3:C\u2081], [4:C\u2082], [5:D\u2081], [6:D\u2082], [7:E].\n\nGoal:\nPost-selectively project the two output modes at detectors 0 and 7 into the Bell state |00>+|11> via a coherent superposition of swapping through mediators B, C, or D.\n\nConfiguration:\n  \u2022 num_pre: 1  \n  \u2022 num_anc (ancilla detectors): 6  \n  \u2022 single_emitters: [0\u20267]  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [1,2,3,4,5,6]  // detectors for mediator photons  \n  \u2022 out_nodes (Bell outputs): [0,7]  \n\nRemoved connections:\n  // A (emitter 0) and E (emitter 7) only connect to their output detectors 0 and 7\n  Forbid edges [[0,i],[7,i]] for i in [1..6]\n  // Mediator emitters B\u2081\u2013D\u2082 ([1..6]) only connect to ancilla detectors [1..6], not to outputs:\n  Forbid edges [[j,0],[j,7]] for j in [1..6]\n\nTarget quantum:\n  // Conditional on exactly one click per mediator pair (post-selecting six ancilla clicks,  \n  // two from each branch combined on the internal interferometer), the state at detectors 0 and 7 is\n  ['00','11']\n\nRemarks:\n  \u2022 The internal linear-optical network must erase the path-label (which mediator) by mixing all six mediator photons in a 3-port tritter-like arrangement, so that the final heralding cannot distinguish B vs C vs D.\n  \u2022 Upon the heralding pattern (six clicks), detectors 0 and 7 collapse into a maximally entangled qubit pair.\n  \u2022 This fully static circuit generalizes to N-branch superpositions by adding more mediator emitter pairs and extending the mixing network, yielding a family of \u201cmulti-branch entanglement-switch\u201d modules for Rydberg-based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While extending entanglement swapping to three parallel mediator branches may sound like a longer chain, it is essentially the same primitive as the \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four\u2010Node Photonic Circuit,\u201d both of which already realize coherent superpositions of multiple swap channels in one shot. Simply going from two to three branches\u2014even with Rydberg-array emitters\u2014does not introduce a qualitatively new resource or protocol, but is a trivial generalization of known multi\u2010path swap schemes.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of superposing multiple entanglement-swap paths already demonstrated by the \u201cEntanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps\u201d experiments. To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "output": "Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201cRydberg atom array\u201d (modeled as independent single-photon emitters in Pytheus) with a genuinely new quantum-network transformation (not mere state generation):\n  1) A static linear-optical network that implements a near-complete Bell-state analyzer for two photonic qubits by injecting two ancilla photons (from Rydberg emitters) and post-selecting on distinctive click patterns.  \n  2) A single circuit that simultaneously teleports two logical qubits across four Rydberg nodes in one \u201cdouble-teleportation\u201d step\u2014cross-swap of two qubits in parallel.  \n  3) A reconfigurable \u201centanglement router\u201d that, conditional on which subset of ancilla detectors clicks, entangles one of three possible remote node-pairs among four Rydberg sites in a single static interferometer.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate novelty and Pytheus-feasibility:\n  1) The Bell-state analyzer is a measurement-network primitive (a transformation), not just creating a Bell pair. It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus."

By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals.

To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement).

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

LOOK AT THE \u2018LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\u2019 WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)\n\n\nResearcher: Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201cRydberg atom array\u201d (modeled as independent single-photon emitters in Pytheus) with a genuinely new quantum-network transformation (not mere state generation):\n  1) A static linear-optical network that implements a near-complete Bell-state analyzer for two photonic qubits by injecting two ancilla photons (from Rydberg emitters) and post-selecting on distinctive click patterns.  \n  2) A single circuit that simultaneously teleports two logical qubits across four Rydberg nodes in one \u201cdouble-teleportation\u201d step\u2014cross-swap of two qubits in parallel.  \n  3) A reconfigurable \u201centanglement router\u201d that, conditional on which subset of ancilla detectors clicks, entangles one of three possible remote node-pairs among four Rydberg sites in a single static interferometer.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate novelty and Pytheus-feasibility:\n  1) The Bell-state analyzer is a measurement-network primitive (a transformation), not just creating a Bell pair. It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state.

Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9).

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is effectively the same primitive as an entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch or indefinite\u2010order entanglement swapping\u2014heralding A\u2013D Bell correlations via a coherent superposition of mediation through B or C. Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals. There\u2019s no new resource or mechanism beyond known optical quantum\u2010switch experiments, so it lacks the novelty needed for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cThree-Branch Coherent Entanglement Swap via Rydberg-Array Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg sites by eight single-photon emitters:\n  Emitters: [0:A], [1:B\u2081], [2:B\u2082], [3:C\u2081], [4:C\u2082], [5:D\u2081], [6:D\u2082], [7:E].\n\nGoal:\nPost-selectively project the two output modes at detectors 0 and 7 into the Bell state |00>+|11> via a coherent superposition of swapping through mediators B, C, or D.\n\nConfiguration:\n  \u2022 num_pre: 1  \n  \u2022 num_anc (ancilla detectors): 6  \n  \u2022 single_emitters: [0\u20267]  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [1,2,3,4,5,6]  // detectors for mediator photons  \n  \u2022 out_nodes (Bell outputs): [0,7]  \n\nRemoved connections:\n  // A (emitter 0) and E (emitter 7) only connect to their output detectors 0 and 7\n  Forbid edges [[0,i],[7,i]] for i in [1..6]\n  // Mediator emitters B\u2081\u2013D\u2082 ([1..6]) only connect to ancilla detectors [1..6], not to outputs:\n  Forbid edges [[j,0],[j,7]] for j in [1..6]\n\nTarget quantum:\n  // Conditional on exactly one click per mediator pair (post-selecting six ancilla clicks,  \n  // two from each branch combined on the internal interferometer), the state at detectors 0 and 7 is\n  ['00','11']\n\nRemarks:\n  \u2022 The internal linear-optical network must erase the path-label (which mediator) by mixing all six mediator photons in a 3-port tritter-like arrangement, so that the final heralding cannot distinguish B vs C vs D.\n  \u2022 Upon the heralding pattern (six clicks), detectors 0 and 7 collapse into a maximally entangled qubit pair.\n  \u2022 This fully static circuit generalizes to N-branch superpositions by adding more mediator emitter pairs and extending the mixing network, yielding a family of \u201cmulti-branch entanglement-switch\u201d modules for Rydberg-based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While extending entanglement swapping to three parallel mediator branches may sound like a longer chain, it is essentially the same primitive as the \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four\u2010Node Photonic Circuit,\u201d both of which already realize coherent superpositions of multiple swap channels in one shot. Simply going from two to three branches\u2014even with Rydberg-array emitters\u2014does not introduce a qualitatively new resource or protocol, but is a trivial generalization of known multi\u2010path swap schemes.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of superposing multiple entanglement-swap paths already demonstrated by the \u201cEntanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps\u201d experiments. To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D. These emitters feed into a single static linear-optical network and are measured by six detectors: two \u201cclient\u201d outputs (labelled 0,1) and four \u201cancilla\u201d detectors (labelled 2\u20135).\n\nBy post-selecting on which pair of ancilla detectors clicks, the same hardware projects a different pair of emitters into a Bell state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh.

To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It remains purely a network transformation (two Bell sources to one partially entangled pair), uses only single-photon emitters + linear optics + number-resolving detectors, no feedback or cavities.  \n  \u2022 Idea 2 would require dynamic feed-forward to switch between swap vs. teleportation\u2014beyond Pytheus\u2019s static framework.  \n  \u2022 Idea 3 moves toward GHZ-like operations (state gen), so it\u2019s disallowed.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea 1: Tunable Partial Entanglement Swapping.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nNo previous Pytheus experiment implements a **continuously tunable** entanglement-swap measurement using ancilla photons to interpolate between no-swap (identity) and full-swap (Bell measurement).

    "output": "Here is a concrete Pytheus\u2010compatible proposal that fuses a Rydberg\u2010array model (as single\u2010photon/pair emitters) with a genuinely new quantum\u2010network primitive\u2014namely **quantum butterfly network coding** via **dual entanglement\u2010swapping**.  \n\nDescription:  \n\u201cQuantum Butterfly Network\u2010Coding via Dual Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nExplanation of the idea:  \nWe have four distant Rydberg\u2010array nodes A, B, C, D.  Each node is connected to one of two intermediate \u201cswitch\u201d stations M\u2081 and M\u2082 by a probabilistic Bell\u2010pair photon source:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 emits to (A, m1\u2081)  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 emits to (B, m1\u2082)  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 emits to (m2\u2081, C)  \n  \u2022 S\u2084 emits to (m2\u2082, D)  \n\nAt the heart of the network is a single static linear\u2010optical circuit that mixes modes  \n  (m1\u2081 \u2194 m2\u2082) and (m1\u2082 \u2194 m2\u2081)  \non beam splitters so as to perform two Bell\u2010measurements **in parallel**\u2014one \u201ccross\u201d swap from A\u2192C and one from B\u2192D.  Post\u2010selecting exactly one photon click in each of the four ancilla detectors at the outputs of that mesh deletes all which\u2010path information and thereby teleports the unknown qubit at A onto C and the unknown qubit at B onto D **simultaneously**, despite the two data streams sharing the same physical bottleneck.  \n\nThis realizes the canonical **butterfly network coding** advantage: two end\u2010to\u2010end teleportation channels share a single switching resource without increasing latency or resource count compared to two independent links.  It is a purely **network** transformation\u2014no new entangled state is simply \u201cproduced,\u201d but rather two unknown qubit\u2010streams are routed crosswise through one static device.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):  \n  Emitters (sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084)  \n      \u2193  \n  Static beam\u2010splitter mesh (mixes m1\u2081,m2\u2082 and m1\u2082,m2\u2081)  \n      \u2193  \n  Detectors:  \n    \u2022 out_nodes = [0:C_out, 1:D_out]  \n    \u2022 anc_detectors = [2,3,4,5]  \n\nKey Pytheus\u2010config elements:  \n  description: \"Butterfly network coding with dual entanglement swapping\"  \n  foldername: \"butterfly_code\"  \n  num_pre: 2  \n  num_anc: 4  \n  single_emitters: []               // using 4 probabilistic pair sources instead  \n  removed_connections: [            // forbid any direct A\u2192D or B\u2192C link  \n    [0,1], [1,0], [2,1], [3,0]  \n  ]  \n  out_nodes: [0,1]  \n  anc_detectors: [2,3,4,5]  \n  target_quantum: [                  // un-normalized 4-photon target  \n    \"0000\",   // ancilla self-click patterns heralding |\u03a6+>\u2297|\u03a6+>  \n    \"0101\",  \n    \"1010\",  \n    \"1111\"  \n  ]  \n  loss_func: \"cr\", optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\", number_resolving: true  \n\nWhy this is novel and interesting:  \n  \u2022 **First photonic demonstration** of quantum network coding in the butterfly geometry via **dual, parallel entanglement-swap**\u2014no prior Pytheus design tackles this.  \n  \u2022 Uses a **single static** interferometer mesh to implement two simultaneous Bell-type measurements over crossing links, maximizing resource sharing.  \n  \u2022 Captures the core advantage of quantum network coding\u2014two independent qubit transmissions over one bottleneck\u2014offering a path to high\u2010throughput repeater nodes.  \n  \u2022 **Generalizes** easily to larger crossbar and mesh topologies by adding more pair sources and modestly enlarging the switching interferometer.  \n\nThis target firmly sits in the \u201cquantum networks\u201d domain (entanglement swapping, teleportation, network coding), is free of dynamic feedback or cavities, and is fully within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is effectively the same primitive as an entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch or indefinite\u2010order entanglement swapping\u2014heralding A\u2013D Bell correlations via a coherent superposition of mediation through B or C. Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals.

To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cThree-Branch Coherent Entanglement Swap via Rydberg-Array Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg sites by eight single-photon emitters:\n  Emitters: [0:A], [1:B\u2081], [2:B\u2082], [3:C\u2081], [4:C\u2082], [5:D\u2081], [6:D\u2082], [7:E].\n\nGoal:\nPost-selectively project the two output modes at detectors 0 and 7 into the Bell state |00>+|11> via a coherent superposition of swapping through mediators B, C, or D.\n\nConfiguration:\n  \u2022 num_pre: 1  \n  \u2022 num_anc (ancilla detectors): 6  \n  \u2022 single_emitters: [0\u20267]  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [1,2,3,4,5,6]  // detectors for mediator photons  \n  \u2022 out_nodes (Bell outputs): [0,7]  \n\nRemoved connections:\n  // A (emitter 0) and E (emitter 7) only connect to their output detectors 0 and 7\n  Forbid edges [[0,i],[7,i]] for i in [1..6]\n  // Mediator emitters B\u2081\u2013D\u2082 ([1..6]) only connect to ancilla detectors [1..6], not to outputs:\n  Forbid edges [[j,0],[j,7]] for j in [1..6]\n\nTarget quantum:\n  // Conditional on exactly one click per mediator pair (post-selecting six ancilla clicks,  \n  // two from each branch combined on the internal interferometer), the state at detectors 0 and 7 is\n  ['00','11']\n\nRemarks:\n  \u2022 The internal linear-optical network must erase the path-label (which mediator) by mixing all six mediator photons in a 3-port tritter-like arrangement, so that the final heralding cannot distinguish B vs C vs D.\n  \u2022 Upon the heralding pattern (six clicks), detectors 0 and 7 collapse into a maximally entangled qubit pair.\n  \u2022 This fully static circuit generalizes to N-branch superpositions by adding more mediator emitter pairs and extending the mixing network, yielding a family of \u201cmulti-branch entanglement-switch\u201d modules for Rydberg-based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While extending entanglement swapping to three parallel mediator branches may sound like a longer chain, it is essentially the same primitive as the \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four\u2010Node Photonic Circuit,\u201d both of which already realize coherent superpositions of multiple swap channels in one shot. Simply going from two to three branches\u2014even with Rydberg-array emitters\u2014does not introduce a qualitatively new resource or protocol, but is a trivial generalization of known multi\u2010path swap schemes.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of superposing multiple entanglement-swap paths already demonstrated by the \u201cEntanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps\u201d experiments. To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D. These emitters feed into a single static linear-optical network and are measured by six detectors: two \u201cclient\u201d outputs (labelled 0,1) and four \u201cancilla\u201d detectors (labelled 2\u20135).\n\nBy post-selecting on which pair of ancilla detectors clicks, the same hardware projects a different pair of emitters into a Bell state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

LOOK AT THE \u2018LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\u2019 WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)\n\n\nResearcher: Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201cRydberg atom array\u201d (modeled as independent single-photon emitters in Pytheus) with a genuinely new quantum-network transformation (not mere state generation):\n  1) A static linear-optical network that implements a near-complete Bell-state analyzer for two photonic qubits by injecting two ancilla photons (from Rydberg emitters) and post-selecting on distinctive click patterns.  \n  2) A single circuit that simultaneously teleports two logical qubits across four Rydberg nodes in one \u201cdouble-teleportation\u201d step\u2014cross-swap of two qubits in parallel.  \n  3) A reconfigurable \u201centanglement router\u201d that, conditional on which subset of ancilla detectors clicks, entangles one of three possible remote node-pairs among four Rydberg sites in a single static interferometer.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate novelty and Pytheus-feasibility:\n  1) The Bell-state analyzer is a measurement-network primitive (a transformation), not just creating a Bell pair. It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

All three photons enter a fixed interferometric network of beam splitters and phase shifters and then impinge on eight number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2087. We choose the mapping:\n\n\u2022 Input basis states S_even = { |00z\u27e9, |11z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083  \n\u2022 Input basis states S_odd  = { |01z\u27e9, |10z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2084\u2026D\u2087  \n\nThe network is optimized so that each of the eight computational basis states is routed to a unique detector. By grouping detectors 0\u20133 as \u201ceven\u201d and 4\u20137 as \u201codd,\u201d a click in one of those four detectors unambiguously heralds the Z\u2297Z parity outcome of the two qubits without measuring them directly.  \n\nPytheus-config hints:\n  single_emitters = [0,1,2]  \n  num_anc = 0  \n  out_nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  \n  removed_connections = [\n    // forbid Q\u2081 or Q\u2082 from sending to detectors in the opposite parity block\n    [0,[4,5,6,7]], [1,[4,5,6,7]],\n    [0,[ ],],[1,[ ],] // etc.\n  ]  \n  target_quantum = ['000','001','010','011','100','101','110','111']  \n                   mapped to detectors [0\u20267] respectively  \n\nNo dynamic feedback or cavities are used\u2014only single-photon sources, static linear optics, and photon\u2010number detectors.  This measurement primitive can be immediately applied to entanglement purification, measurement\u2010device-independent QKD, and distributed error detection in Rydberg-based quantum networks\u2014and generalizes to N-qubit parity checks by adding more ancilla photons and detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Two-qubit parity checks via static linear optics and ancilla photons are well-explored (see KLM\u2010style parity gates, nonlocal XOR, 4-body stabilizer readout).

Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

LOOK AT THE \u2018LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\u2019 WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)\n\n\nResearcher: Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201cRydberg atom array\u201d (modeled as independent single-photon emitters in Pytheus) with a genuinely new quantum-network transformation (not mere state generation):\n  1) A static linear-optical network that implements a near-complete Bell-state analyzer for two photonic qubits by injecting two ancilla photons (from Rydberg emitters) and post-selecting on distinctive click patterns.  \n  2) A single circuit that simultaneously teleports two logical qubits across four Rydberg nodes in one \u201cdouble-teleportation\u201d step\u2014cross-swap of two qubits in parallel.  \n  3) A reconfigurable \u201centanglement router\u201d that, conditional on which subset of ancilla detectors clicks, entangles one of three possible remote node-pairs among four Rydberg sites in a single static interferometer.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate novelty and Pytheus-feasibility:\n  1) The Bell-state analyzer is a measurement-network primitive (a transformation), not just creating a Bell pair. It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

All three photons enter a fixed interferometric network of beam splitters and phase shifters and then impinge on eight number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2087. We choose the mapping:\n\n\u2022 Input basis states S_even = { |00z\u27e9, |11z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083  \n\u2022 Input basis states S_odd  = { |01z\u27e9, |10z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2084\u2026D\u2087  \n\nThe network is optimized so that each of the eight computational basis states is routed to a unique detector. By grouping detectors 0\u20133 as \u201ceven\u201d and 4\u20137 as \u201codd,\u201d a click in one of those four detectors unambiguously heralds the Z\u2297Z parity outcome of the two qubits without measuring them directly.  \n\nPytheus-config hints:\n  single_emitters = [0,1,2]  \n  num_anc = 0  \n  out_nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  \n  removed_connections = [\n    // forbid Q\u2081 or Q\u2082 from sending to detectors in the opposite parity block\n    [0,[4,5,6,7]], [1,[4,5,6,7]],\n    [0,[ ],],[1,[ ],] // etc.\n  ]  \n  target_quantum = ['000','001','010','011','100','101','110','111']  \n                   mapped to detectors [0\u20267] respectively  \n\nNo dynamic feedback or cavities are used\u2014only single-photon sources, static linear optics, and photon\u2010number detectors.  This measurement primitive can be immediately applied to entanglement purification, measurement\u2010device-independent QKD, and distributed error detection in Rydberg-based quantum networks\u2014and generalizes to N-qubit parity checks by adding more ancilla photons and detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Two-qubit parity checks via static linear optics and ancilla photons are well-explored (see KLM\u2010style parity gates, nonlocal XOR, 4-body stabilizer readout).

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially just two consecutive entanglement swaps packaged into one static interferometer\u2014a straightforward concatenation of the standard two-node swapping protocol. Both the foundational entanglement\u2010swapping experiment (Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted) and its multi\u2010swap extensions (e.g. Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs, the \u201cbutterfly\u201d four\u2010photon joint measurement, or the one\u2010shot swap\u2010and\u2010concentrate repeater) already cover this construction. As a trivial chain\u2010lengthening of known schemes, it lacks the novelty required for a PRL\u2010level target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the circuit. We perform entanglement swapping between A and D by two possible mediator nodes B or C, but we erase the which\u2010mediator information by interfering their ancillary photons on a small beam\u2010splitter mesh. Post\u2010selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors heralds that A and D are projected into a Bell state via a coherent superposition of the two swap channels.\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):\n Emitters:     [0:A] [1:B\u2081] [2:B\u2082] [3:C\u2081] [4:C\u2082] [5:D]  \n Setup:        Static linear\u2010optical circuit mixing modes from B and C  \n Detectors:   [0:A_out] [1:D_out] [2] [3] [4] [5]   // detectors 2\u20135 are ancilla\n\nKey constraints:\n \u2022 removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5]]  \n   (forbid any mediator emitter from sending to A_out or D_out)  \n \u2022 no direct source connects A and D  \n \u2022 post\u2010select four ancilla clicks to herald swap  \n \u2022 target_quantum = ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1]\n\nThis design generalizes to more mediator nodes or hierarchical superpositions of swap\u2010channels, offering a new family of repeater\u2010like, superposed\u2010topology quantum networks implementable by Pytheus.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is effectively the same primitive as an entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch or indefinite\u2010order entanglement swapping\u2014heralding A\u2013D Bell correlations via a coherent superposition of mediation through B or C. Nearly identical targets appear in both the ensemble\u2019s \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch\u201d (superposing two swap sequences) and the cyclic indefinite\u2010order swap proposals. There\u2019s no new resource or mechanism beyond known optical quantum\u2010switch experiments, so it lacks the novelty needed for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is essentially the same as the entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch and other indefinite\u2010order swapping schemes already in the literature. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new twist\u2014e.g. a different physical resource, higher\u2010order causal structures, or topologically nontrivial superpositions\u2014not just two\u2010path superposition of standard swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cThree-Branch Coherent Entanglement Swap via Rydberg-Array Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg sites by eight single-photon emitters:\n  Emitters: [0:A], [1:B\u2081], [2:B\u2082], [3:C\u2081], [4:C\u2082], [5:D\u2081], [6:D\u2082], [7:E].\n\nGoal:\nPost-selectively project the two output modes at detectors 0 and 7 into the Bell state |00>+|11> via a coherent superposition of swapping through mediators B, C, or D.\n\nConfiguration:\n  \u2022 num_pre: 1  \n  \u2022 num_anc (ancilla detectors): 6  \n  \u2022 single_emitters: [0\u20267]  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [1,2,3,4,5,6]  // detectors for mediator photons  \n  \u2022 out_nodes (Bell outputs): [0,7]  \n\nRemoved connections:\n  // A (emitter 0) and E (emitter 7) only connect to their output detectors 0 and 7\n  Forbid edges [[0,i],[7,i]] for i in [1..6]\n  // Mediator emitters B\u2081\u2013D\u2082 ([1..6]) only connect to ancilla detectors [1..6], not to outputs:\n  Forbid edges [[j,0],[j,7]] for j in [1..6]\n\nTarget quantum:\n  // Conditional on exactly one click per mediator pair (post-selecting six ancilla clicks,  \n  // two from each branch combined on the internal interferometer), the state at detectors 0 and 7 is\n  ['00','11']\n\nRemarks:\n  \u2022 The internal linear-optical network must erase the path-label (which mediator) by mixing all six mediator photons in a 3-port tritter-like arrangement, so that the final heralding cannot distinguish B vs C vs D.\n  \u2022 Upon the heralding pattern (six clicks), detectors 0 and 7 collapse into a maximally entangled qubit pair.\n  \u2022 This fully static circuit generalizes to N-branch superpositions by adding more mediator emitter pairs and extending the mixing network, yielding a family of \u201cmulti-branch entanglement-switch\u201d modules for Rydberg-based quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While extending entanglement swapping to three parallel mediator branches may sound like a longer chain, it is essentially the same primitive as the \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four\u2010Node Photonic Circuit,\u201d both of which already realize coherent superpositions of multiple swap channels in one shot. Simply going from two to three branches\u2014even with Rydberg-array emitters\u2014does not introduce a qualitatively new resource or protocol, but is a trivial generalization of known multi\u2010path swap schemes.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of superposing multiple entanglement-swap paths already demonstrated by the \u201cEntanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect\u2010Matching Entanglement Swaps\u201d experiments. To be PRL-worthy, you must introduce a fundamentally new element\u2014e.g. non-trivial causal order beyond multi-branch superposition, integration of a novel non-linear interaction, or a topologically protected mediation mechanism\u2014not merely increase the number of swapping arms.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n\u201cReconfigurable Entanglement Router for Four Rydberg Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model four remote Rydberg\u2010atom sites by four independent single-photon emitters A, B, C, D. These emitters feed into a single static linear-optical network and are measured by six detectors: two \u201cclient\u201d outputs (labelled 0,1) and four \u201cancilla\u201d detectors (labelled 2\u20135).\n\nBy post-selecting on which pair of ancilla detectors clicks, the same hardware projects a different pair of emitters into a Bell state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

We model the two unknown qubit photons (to be Bell\u2010measured) plus two ancilla photons (emitted from two additional Rydberg\u2010array sites) as four single\u2010photon sources.  A fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters mixes these four modes and routes them to six number\u2010resolving detectors.  Whenever exactly one click occurs in each ancilla detector and two clicks among the remaining four \u201cBell\u2010outcome\u201d detectors, the click pattern uniquely identifies which Bell state the input pair was in; all other patterns are discarded as inconclusive.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D. Each node is represented by a single\u2010photon emitter in the optical circuit. We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement). To be novel, you need a genuinely new twist\u2014such as non\u2010trivial superposition of swap orders, topology\u2010protected routing, or integration with an entirely new resource beyond simple chain\u2010lengthening.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It realizes a \u201cquantum switch\u201d of two swap channels in a single static optical circuit.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only single\u2010photon emitters (modeling Rydberg sites), linear\u2010optical mixing (to erase which\u2010mediator information), and photon\u2010number detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no direct state generation, just a clear post\u2010selected network task.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cCoherent Superposition of Two-Path Entanglement Swapping via Rydberg\u2010Array Nodes\u201d\n\nWe label four remote Rydberg nodes A, B, C, D.

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Eavesdropper localization for quantum and classical channels via\n  nonlinear scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum and semi--quantum key distribution in networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It stays within entanglement\u2010swapping/quantum\u2010network paradigms, uses only single-photon emitters and beamsplitters, and needs no feedback control.  \n  2) The hub\u2010and-spoke star distribution edges toward GHZ/hyper-entanglement generation, which is closer to state generation.  \n  3) The multi-hop teleportation requires dynamic feed-forward corrections to recover the teleported state, which Pytheus cannot design.  \n\nStep 3: The 4-node chain of entanglement swaps is the most promising.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus designs have concatenated two sequential entanglement\u2010swapping operations into one compact network to connect end nodes A and D across two intermediate Rydberg nodes B and C. Combining both swaps in a single circuit can reduce ancillary modes versus two isolated swap setups.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it only demands:  \n  \u2022 single-photon emitters (modeling the Rydberg sites)  \n  \u2022 linear-optical mixing and post-selected photon counting  \n  \u2022 no feedback loops or cavities  \n  \u2022 a clear quantum-network task (two-hop entanglement swapping) rather than standalone state generation  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nDescription of target: \u201c4-Node Chain Entanglement Swapping for Rydberg\u2010Based Quantum Repeaters\u201d  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe label four remote Rydberg\u2010array nodes A,B,C,D.

We want to post-selectively entangle the qubit at A with the qubit at D by performing two back-to-back entanglement\u2010swapping measurements at the intermediate nodes B and C\u2014all within one static linear-optical network.  \n\nGeneral structure (top to bottom):  \n  Emitters: [1:A] [2:B\u2081] [3:B\u2082] [4:C\u2081] [5:C\u2082] [6:D]  \n  \u2192 beam-splitter network to distribute photons among detectors  \n  Detectors: [A_out] [D_out] [swap_B_1] [swap_B_2] [swap_C_1] [swap_C_2]  \n\nConstraints:  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any source sending directly to both A_out & D_out  \n  \u2022 no common emitter linking A and D without going through B or C  \n  \u2022 four ancilla detection modes (swap_B_1, swap_B_2, swap_C_1, swap_C_2) herald successful two-step swapping  \n\nTarget quantum (un\u2010normalized):  \n  |00\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e + |11\u3009\u208dA,D\u208e  \n\nIn this configuration, the two-step entanglement swap is implemented in one combined interferometer. Post-selecting on clicks in the four ancilla detectors projects the remaining two modes (A_out, D_out) into a Bell state. This design generalizes directly to longer chains (more intermediate Rydberg nodes) with only linear increases in emitters and ancilla detectors, opening a path toward integrated photonic repeater modules for Rydberg\u2010based quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is a direct concatenation of standard entanglement\u2010swapping blocks (one Bell pair swap at B, followed by another at C), a trivial extension of both the textbook two\u2010node swap and known multi\u2010swap experiments (e.g. \u201cEntanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs\u201d and the ensemble\u2019s butterfly\u2010network joint measurement).

It uses only single-photon emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, no feedback\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities\u2014and I do not see a prior Pytheus design for a three-state unambiguous Bell measurement.  \n  2) Double-teleportation would require dynamic feed-forward corrections to route two qubits simultaneously\u2014Pytheus cannot design that.  \n  3) The conditional router is close to existing \u201centanglement switch\u201d ideas and was flagged as insufficiently novel.\n\nStep 3: The most promising is idea #1: a near-complete Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has tackled the design of a static linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states by injecting two ancilla photons. Standard linear optics without ancillas can only distinguish two; with ancillas one can in principle reach three, but an explicit interferometric layout with minimal resources has not been generated by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because:\n  \u2022 We only need four single-photon emitters (two for the qubit pair to be measured + two Rydberg-mode ancillas).  \n  \u2022 A purely static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network that mixes these four photons and routes them to six number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no feedback loops.  \n  \u2022 Post-selected detection patterns herald unambiguous identification of three Bell states; the fourth remains inconclusive.  \n  \u2022 It is a measurement-network transformation (Bell-measurement), not state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n\u201cStatic Linear-Optical Three-State Bell-State Analyzer Using Rydberg-Array Ancillas\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe model two input qubits (in an unknown Bell state) by single-photon emitters Q\u2081 and Q\u2082, and we supply two ancilla single photons from separate Rydberg sites A and B. All four photons enter a fixed network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and are directed to six number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085. By post-selecting on exactly four clicks\u2014two clicks occurring on designated \u201cancilla detectors\u201d and two on the \u201cinput detectors\u201d\u2014we obtain three distinct click-patterns that each unambiguously signal one of three Bell states (|\u03c8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03c8\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9). Any other click pattern is discarded (inconclusive for |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9).  \n\nConfiguration outline:\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [Q1,Q2,A,B]  \n  \u2022 out_nodes = [D0,D1]   (where the two input photons would land)  \n  \u2022 anc_detectors = [D2,D3,D4,D5]  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any emitter from directly coupling only to D0,D1 (to ensure mixing)  \n  \u2022 target_mapping: three disjoint sets of four-click outcomes \u2192 {Bell state label}\n\nThis circuit realizes a near-complete Bell measurement\u2014a key primitive for teleportation, entanglement swapping and MDI-QKD\u2014using only static linear optics and two Rydberg-sourced ancilla photons. It immediately generalizes to higher success probability or to four-state discrimination by adding more ancillas and a slightly larger interferometer, opening a new family of measurement-based quantum network protocols accessible to Pytheus.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Existing ancilla-photon Bell analyzers already achieve three-state discrimination via static interferometers (see Grice PRA 84, 042331 or the ensemble\u2019s bound-state analyzer). To be novel, you need a fundamentally new mechanism\u2014e.g. exploiting Rydberg nonlinearity in-circuit rather than treating them as simple single-photon ancillas, a deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a novel physical degree of freedom beyond standard linear optics.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

All three photons enter a fixed interferometric network of beam splitters and phase shifters and then impinge on eight number-resolving detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2087. We choose the mapping:\n\n\u2022 Input basis states S_even = { |00z\u27e9, |11z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083  \n\u2022 Input basis states S_odd  = { |01z\u27e9, |10z\u27e9 } for z\u2208{0,1} \u2192 detectors D\u2084\u2026D\u2087  \n\nThe network is optimized so that each of the eight computational basis states is routed to a unique detector. By grouping detectors 0\u20133 as \u201ceven\u201d and 4\u20137 as \u201codd,\u201d a click in one of those four detectors unambiguously heralds the Z\u2297Z parity outcome of the two qubits without measuring them directly.  \n\nPytheus-config hints:\n  single_emitters = [0,1,2]  \n  num_anc = 0  \n  out_nodes = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  \n  removed_connections = [\n    // forbid Q\u2081 or Q\u2082 from sending to detectors in the opposite parity block\n    [0,[4,5,6,7]], [1,[4,5,6,7]],\n    [0,[ ],],[1,[ ],] // etc.\n  ]  \n  target_quantum = ['000','001','010','011','100','101','110','111']  \n                   mapped to detectors [0\u20267] respectively  \n\nNo dynamic feedback or cavities are used\u2014only single-photon sources, static linear optics, and photon\u2010number detectors.  This measurement primitive can be immediately applied to entanglement purification, measurement\u2010device-independent QKD, and distributed error detection in Rydberg-based quantum networks\u2014and generalizes to N-qubit parity checks by adding more ancilla photons and detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Two-qubit parity checks via static linear optics and ancilla photons are well-explored (see KLM\u2010style parity gates, nonlocal XOR, 4-body stabilizer readout). To be PRL-worthy, you need a truly novel twist\u2014e.g. exploiting genuine Rydberg interactions in-circuit, achieving deterministic four-state discrimination without feed-forward, or coupling to a new degree of freedom\u2014rather than a trivial parity\u2010check mapping.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It remains purely a network transformation (two Bell sources to one partially entangled pair), uses only single-photon emitters + linear optics + number-resolving detectors, no feedback or cavities.  \n  \u2022 Idea 2 would require dynamic feed-forward to switch between swap vs. teleportation\u2014beyond Pytheus\u2019s static framework.  \n  \u2022 Idea 3 moves toward GHZ-like operations (state gen), so it\u2019s disallowed.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea 1: Tunable Partial Entanglement Swapping.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nNo previous Pytheus experiment implements a **continuously tunable** entanglement-swap measurement using ancilla photons to interpolate between no-swap (identity) and full-swap (Bell measurement).

A single static linear\u2010optical circuit mixes the four modes at B (the two \u201chalf\u2010pairs\u201d and two ancillas) and routes all six photons to detectors.

No dynamic feed-forward or specialized nonlinearities are required.  The scheme generalizes immediately to longer catalyst chains or multi-node catalytic networks."
