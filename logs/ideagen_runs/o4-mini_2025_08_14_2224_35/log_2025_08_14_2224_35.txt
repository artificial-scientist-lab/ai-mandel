    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements."

By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored. Simply cascading them in a single circuit does not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive or reveal a novel quantum effect.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS\nALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. \u2013 PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM.

    "output": "Thought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to merge \u201ccomplex quantum algorithm\u201d + \u201centanglement witness\u201d:\n  1) A single joint measurement that both swaps high\u2010D entanglement and evaluates a witness at once\u2014i.e. a \u201cSwap\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.\u201d  \n  2) A teleportation\u2010based implementation of a two\u2010qubit oracle (Deutsch\u2013Jozsa) where the oracle is applied via entanglement swapping, followed by an in\u2010line witness\u2010measurement of the output entanglement.  \n  3) A small nonadaptive linear-optical phase-estimation circuit (a one\u2010qubit QFT) built into an entanglement\u2010swapping chain, with a final witness step certifying both algorithmic coherence and entanglement.  \nStep 2: Quick feasibility & novelty:\n  1) No Pytheus experiment so far fuses swapping and witness into one measurement block.

It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k.

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy.

By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

    "output": "Thought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201ccomplex quantum algorithm\u201d + \u201centanglement witness\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible target:\n    1) A single linear\u2010optical network that teleports a two\u2010qubit CNOT gate between remote photons (via entanglement swapping) and in the same measurement solves a Bell\u2010inequality\u2010type entanglement witness on the output\u2014i.e. a \u201cCNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.\u201d  \n    2) A network that implements a small phase\u2010estimation subroutine (a three\u2010mode Fourier transform) on an entangled pair and then projects onto a multipartite witness operator in one fused measurement.  \n    3) A teleportation\u2010based implementation of a two\u2010bit parity function (algorithmic) on teleported qubits, followed immediately by a generalized entanglement witness to certify the resource was indeed entangled during the computation.  \n  Step 2: Feasibility & novelty check:\n    1) Heralded CNOT gates have been designed, and entanglement\u2010witness measurements too\u2014but no one has asked Pytheus to design a single network that both implements a nontrivial two-qubit algorithm (CNOT) via teleportation and simultaneously reads out an entanglement witness, all in one block. It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network. This opens a family of \u201calgorithm+certification\u201d building blocks for photonic quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It invokes only abstract beam\u2010splitter arrays, probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the multiport unitary so that one subset of detectors heralds a successful teleported CNOT, while another subset\u2019s coincidence statistics directly give \u27e8W\u27e9 for a chosen witness (e.g. CHSH witness) on the post-CNOT output.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined.

This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network. This opens a family of \u201calgorithm+certification\u201d building blocks for photonic quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It invokes only abstract beam\u2010splitter arrays, probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the multiport unitary so that one subset of detectors heralds a successful teleported CNOT, while another subset\u2019s coincidence statistics directly give \u27e8W\u27e9 for a chosen witness (e.g. CHSH witness) on the post-CNOT output. There is no feedback control, no forbidden state\u2010generation hardware, and everything is cast as \u201cdesign a network + measurement\u201d\u2014exactly what Pytheus is built for.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a \u201cCNOT-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d as a new Pytheus target: one linear\u2010optical network that\u2014starting from two independent Bell-pair sources (four photons) plus ancillas\u2014simultaneously  \n  (i) teleports a two-qubit CNOT gate between the remote qubits via an entanglement-swapping subnetwork, and  \n  (ii) in the very same interferometer and detection event, implements an entanglement witness measurement (e.g. CHSH-type or stabilizer witness) on the two output qubits.  \n\nGeneral structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):  \n  \u2022 Sources:  \n      \u2013 S\u2081 emits photons in modes A,C (Bell pair 1)  \n      \u2013 S\u2082 emits photons in modes D,F (Bell pair 2)  \n      \u2013 Ancilla single photons in modes G,H for the CNOT teleportation gadget  \n      \u2013 (Optionally) Ancilla modes I,J for the witness block  \n  \u2022 Multiport network U mixes modes C,D,G,H (to realize the teleportation\u2010CNOT projector) and then mixes A,F,I,J (to realize the witness projector W).  \n  \u2022 Detectors:  \n      \u2013 {Det\u2081\u2026Det\u2096} record the heralding click pattern of the teleportation gadget \u2192 flags when CNOT has been applied to A\u2192F.  \n      \u2013 {Det\u2096\u208a\u2081\u2026Det\u2099} record the witness measurement outcomes on A,F & ancillas \u2192 their coincidence probabilities yield Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}^out].  \n\nKey features:  \n  \u2022 In one nonadaptive shot you both implement a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate and certify that the resulting qubits are genuinely entangled (\u27e8W\u27e9\u2009<\u20090).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward is required: we post-select on the combined herald + witness pattern.  \n  \u2022 By swapping the gate (CNOT) for other teleportation-based two-qubit gates (CZ, SWAP) and changing W, one obtains a whole family of \u201calgorithm+certification\u201d modules for quantum networks.  \n  \u2022 Entirely within Pytheus: abstract target = \u201cproject to CNOT-teleportation subspace \u2297 witness subspace,\u201d ancilla resources, linear\u2010optical unitary to optimize, no forbidden hardware.\n\nThis fused CNOT-plus-witness primitive opens a new domain of quantum\u2010network design problems\u2014delivering nontrivial algorithmic transformations and built-in entanglement certification in a single photonic circuit.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation\u2010based CNOTs (e.g. heralded linear\u2010optical CNOT gates) and static entanglement\u2010witness circuits are already established. Simply cascading them into a single post\u2010selected network does not produce a novel quantum\u2010network primitive.

By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D.

Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection.

By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B.

By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t.

Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored. Simply cascading them in a single circuit does not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive or reveal a novel quantum effect.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"complex quantum algorithm\" and \"entanglement witness\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1. A generalized Bell\u2010measurement on modes C and D (the middle photons) that, upon a heralding click pattern, entangles the remote photons A and F (entanglement swapping).\n  2. In the very same optical circuit and detection event, projects modes A and F (together with two fresh ancilla) onto the basis elements of a chosen entanglement witness W, so that the click pattern directly yields Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].\n\nVisualization:\n  \u2022 Input modes:\n      \u2013 Sources S\u2081 emit photons in modes A\u2013C (entangled pair 1)  \n      \u2013 Sources S\u2082 emit photons in modes D\u2013F (entangled pair 2)  \n      \u2013 Ancilla photons in modes G, H  \n  \u2022 Multiport network U (beam splitters + phase shifters) mixes C,D,G,H,A,F  \n  \u2022 Detectors:\n      \u2013 Heralding detectors on some outputs of U \u2192 confirms successful swap  \n      \u2013 Witness detectors on the remaining outputs \u2192 specific coincidences compute \u27e8W\u27e9  \n  \u2022 Output:\n      \u2013 A click on the heralding subset signals that A\u2009&\u2009F are entangled  \n      \u2013 Simultaneous click\u2010pattern on the \u201cwitness\u201d detectors gives the numerical value of the witness, certifying genuine high\u2010D entanglement in \u03c1_{AF}.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:\n  \u2022 It lifts entanglement swapping from \u201cproduce state then separately verify\u201d to a unified \u201cone\u2010shot distribute+certify\u201d primitive.  \n  \u2022 By changing the dimension of sources (qutrits \u2192 ququarts) or choosing different W, one obtains a family of Swap-and-Witness Analyzers.  \n  \u2022 Such fused measurement blocks could become modular subroutines in larger quantum\u2010network protocols\u2014delivering entanglement and proof in a single operation.  \n  \u2022 Entirely within Pytheus\u2019s scope: abstract target description (swap + witness projector), no feedback, no cavities\u2014pure linear optics + ancilla + detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both high-dimensional swapping (cf. \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical entanglement witnesses/Schur analyzers already exist. To reach PRL level, you\u2019d need a nontrivial fusion that cannot be decomposed into separate swap+certify steps\u2014e.g. a single joint measurement with fewer resources or novel interference that intrinsically couples distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

    "output": "Thought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus\u2010compatible fusions of \u201ccomplex quantum algorithm\u201d + \u201centanglement witness\u201d without falling back on pure state generation:\n    1) A teleportation\u2010based phase\u2010gate channel analyzer that both applies R\u2099(\u03c0/2) to an unknown qubit via entanglement swapping and simultaneously performs a process\u2010entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the input\u2013output pair (i.e. certifies the quantum nature of the gate as a channel witness).  \n    2) A butterfly\u2010style quantum network\u2010coding router that entangles four nodes in a \u201cbutterfly\u201d swap, and in the same shot runs a CHSH\u2010witness on two of the output links.  \n    3) A cyclic three\u2010node entanglement swapping algorithm for GHZ distribution whose joint measurement interferes the swap legs and yields a GHZ\u2010stabilizer witness outcome in a single fused analyzer.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    1) The process\u2010witness idea sits at the interface of channel certification and gate teleportation; Pytheus can design the static interferometer and ancilla arrangement to realize both the teleportation\u2010gate and the subsequent two\u2010qubit witness measurement in one post\u2010selected event. This has not been explored by prior Pytheus targets.  \n    2) The butterfly+coded CHSH is interesting but still two separate primitives fused; nothing intrinsically new emerges beyond concatenation.  \n    3) The cyclic GHZ\u2010witness also decomposes into known swap + witness modules.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea #1: the teleportation\u2010gate plus channel entanglement witness.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment designs a single linear\u2010optical network that both teleports and applies a nontrivial single\u2010qubit gate to an unknown input AND at the same time projects the input\u2013output pair onto the support of an entanglement witness for that quantum channel. It elevates entanglement swapping from \u201cproduce entanglement\u201d to \u201cimplement+certify a quantum gate\u201d in one step.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: The network uses only two Bell\u2010pair sources, two ancilla photons, a static beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter array, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the combined projector (teleportation\u2010gate projector \u2297 witness projector) without invoking feedback or non\u2010linear hardware.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose as a new Pytheus target a \u201cTeleportation\u2010Gate + Channel\u2010Entanglement\u2010Witness Analyzer.\u201d It is a single static linear\u2010optical network that:\n\n1) Teleports and applies a phase gate R_z(\u03c0/2) on an unknown photonic qubit via entanglement\u2010swapping subcircuit.  \n2) Simultaneously projects the input\u2013output qubit pair onto the measurement bases needed to evaluate a CHSH\u2010type entanglement witness W_channel = 2\u00b7I \u2013 (X\u2297X + X\u2297Z + Z\u2297X \u2013 Z\u2297Z).  \n\nVisualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 S\u2081 emits a Bell pair into modes In\u2081, Anc\u2081  \n    \u2013 S\u2082 emits a Bell pair into modes Gate\u2081, Out  \n\u2022 Ancilla single photons in modes Aux\u2081, Aux\u2082  \n\u2022 Network:\n    \u2013 Stage 1: Mix Anc\u2081, Gate\u2081, Aux\u2081, Aux\u2082 on a multiport U\u2081 to realize the teleportation\u2010gate projector.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network. This opens a family of \u201calgorithm+certification\u201d building blocks for photonic quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It invokes only abstract beam\u2010splitter arrays, probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the multiport unitary so that one subset of detectors heralds a successful teleported CNOT, while another subset\u2019s coincidence statistics directly give \u27e8W\u27e9 for a chosen witness (e.g. CHSH witness) on the post-CNOT output.

Simply cascading them into a single post\u2010selected network does not produce a novel quantum\u2010network primitive.

This defines a new fused\u2010measurement primitive for quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It only uses abstract photonic modes, two Bell\u2010pair sources, four ancilla photons, static beam splitters + phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can treat the entire target as \u201cproject onto Fock patterns P\u2081,P\u2082\u201d (the joint subspace) and find an optimal multiport without any forbidden hardware or feedback.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a \u201cCNOT\u00d7CHSH Fused Analyzer\u201d as a new Pytheus target: one static linear\u2010optical network that\u2014given two Bell\u2010pair sources and four ancilla photons\u2014performs in a single post\u2010selected measurement both\n  a) a teleportation\u2010based CNOT gate on two unknown qubits,\n  b) a CHSH\u2010type entanglement witness on the teleported outputs.\n\nKey idea:  \n\u2022 Instead of cascading a CNOT\u2010teleportation block and then a separate CHSH\u2010witness block, we define one joint projector onto the 8\u2010mode Fock subspace spanned by two specific click\u2010patterns P\u2081,P\u2082. Each pattern simultaneously signals \u201cCNOT succeeded\u201d and \u201cCHSH\u2010beat threshold.\u201d  \n\u2022 This fused measurement cannot be decomposed into two independent subcircuits; it exploits interference between gate\u2010ancillas and witness\u2010ancillas.\n\nGeneral structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n1.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

This has not been explored by prior Pytheus targets.  \n    2) The butterfly+coded CHSH is interesting but still two separate primitives fused; nothing intrinsically new emerges beyond concatenation.  \n    3) The cyclic GHZ\u2010witness also decomposes into known swap + witness modules.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea #1: the teleportation\u2010gate plus channel entanglement witness.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment designs a single linear\u2010optical network that both teleports and applies a nontrivial single\u2010qubit gate to an unknown input AND at the same time projects the input\u2013output pair onto the support of an entanglement witness for that quantum channel. It elevates entanglement swapping from \u201cproduce entanglement\u201d to \u201cimplement+certify a quantum gate\u201d in one step.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: The network uses only two Bell\u2010pair sources, two ancilla photons, a static beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter array, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

It elevates entanglement swapping from \u201cproduce entanglement\u201d to \u201cimplement+certify a quantum gate\u201d in one step.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: The network uses only two Bell\u2010pair sources, two ancilla photons, a static beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter array, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target.

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

It elevates entanglement swapping from \u201cproduce entanglement\u201d to \u201cimplement+certify a quantum gate\u201d in one step.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: The network uses only two Bell\u2010pair sources, two ancilla photons, a static beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter array, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B.

By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target.

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network.

It stays within probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancillas, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback or forbidden hardware.\n    2) Idea (2) and (3) reduce to separate modules and lack a genuinely fused measurement primitive.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: It defines one static linear\u2010optical network whose click patterns simultaneously herald a Bell measurement at the intermediate node and yield two CHSH\u2010witness outcomes on pairs (A\u2013B and A\u2013C). This directly tests the monogamy trade\u2010off P\u2081\u00b2 + P\u2082\u00b2 \u2264 8 in a single fused analyzer\u2014never done in Pytheus.\n  Step 5: Feasibility: Requires two EPR sources (AB and BC), two single\u2010photon ancillas, a beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter multiport mixing modes B,C and ancillas, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the unitary so that certain detector\u2010coincidence subsets give CHSH_AB and CHSH_AC values while simultaneously performing the swapping.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a \u201cMonogamy\u2010Witness Swap Network\u201d as a new Pytheus target. One static linear\u2010optical circuit that\u2014with two EPR\u2010pair sources and two ancilla photons\u2014simultaneously:\n  (i) Performs entanglement swapping at node B (mixing modes B and C) to deliver an A\u2013C link,\n  (ii) Runs two overlapping CHSH entanglement witnesses on pairs A\u2013B and A\u2013C in the very same network.\n\nStructure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Sources:\n      S\u2081 \u2192 modes A,B  \n      S\u2082 \u2192 modes B\u2032,C  (we identify B\u2032\u2261B for swapping)  \n  \u2022 Ancillas: photons in modes E,F  \n  \u2022 Multiport U mixes B, B\u2032, E, F with appropriate beam splitters & phases.\n  \u2022 Detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2085:\n      \u2013 A subset of coincidences on {D\u2080,D\u2081} and {D\u2082,D\u2083} herald the Bell\u2010measurement at B (successful swap).\n      \u2013 Coincidences on {D\u2084,D\u2085} vs {D\u2080,D\u2082} yield the four correlation outcomes needed for CHSH_AB.\n      \u2013 Coincidences on {D\u2081,D\u2083} vs {D\u2084,D\u2085} yield the four correlation outcomes for CHSH_AC.\n\nFrom the three simultaneous correlation datasets one computes \u27e8CHSH_AB\u27e9 and \u27e8CHSH_AC\u27e9.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While integrating high-dimensional entanglement swapping and an on-the-fly qutrit entanglement witness into one static network is a nice engineering touch, both primitives\u2014the generalized Bell swap for two qutrit Bell pairs (see \u201cEntanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits\u201d) and linear-optical implementations of entanglement witnesses or Schur analyzers\u2014are already well explored.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Unmasking the Polygamous Nature of Quantum Nonlocality\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Improved coherent one-way quantum key distribution for high-loss\n  channels\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Experimental mode-pairing measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution without global phase-locking\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feasible: uses only linear optics, probabilistic pairs, detectors.\n    2) Overlaps too much with teleportation\u2010gate examples and quantum computing focus (forbidden).\n    3) Tropes of cluster\u2010state generation (forbidden: state generation).\n  Step 3: Pick idea #1 as most novel and Pytheus\u2010feasible.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no current pytheus experiments combine multilevel entanglement swapping and a built\u2010in entanglement\u2010witness measurement\u2014all in one linear\u2010optical network design\u2014and it opens a family of designs for different dimensions and different witness criteria.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires specifying an abstract target that fuses a qutrit\u2010swapped Bell pair with the subsequent projection patterns that realize a standard linear\u2010optical entanglement witness; Pytheus can optimize beam\u2010splitter layouts, ancilla modes and detectors accordingly without invoking state\u2010generation hardware details or feedback control.\n)\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a new class of quantum\u2010optical network experiments that 1) performs entanglement swapping on two qutrit Bell pairs via ancillary photons, and 2) immediately runs a linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010witness measurement on the swapped output\u2014integrating distribution and certification of high\u2010dimensional entanglement in one architecture.  \n\nExplanation and visualization:  \n - Sources: six single\u2010photon qutrit\u2010pair emitters generating two Bell\u2010like qutrit pairs (modes A\u2013C and D\u2013F).  \n - Swapping subnetwork: Charlie uses beam splitters and ancillary detectors (modes G\u2013L) to perform a generalized Bell\u2010measurement on C and D, heralding entanglement between A and F in the three\u2010dimensional space.  \n - Witness subnetwork: immediately after heralding, modes A and F are fed, together with two fresh ancilla photons (modes M,N), into a small interferometric circuit that implements the standard qutrit entanglement witness  \n    W = \u03b1\u00b7I \u2212 |\u03a8\u208a\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8\u208a|  \n  via multiport beam splitters and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. Specific coincidence patterns on detectors O\u2013R yield a direct estimate of Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AF}].  \n - Heralding: a joint detection on G\u2013L confirms swapping, simultaneous detections on O\u2013R yield the witness outcome. A negative witness value (below threshold) certifies genuine 3-D entanglement on A\u2013F.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:  \n - It unifies two key primitives\u2014high-D entanglement distribution and one-shot entanglement certification\u2014into a single linear-optical network that Pytheus can optimize.  \n - The same architecture scales to higher dimensions (ququarts, qudits) by increasing the number of inputs and ancilla, and to different witness operators by adjusting which coincidence patterns are targeted.  \n - It opens the door to integrated \u201centanglement\u2010delivery\u2010and\u2010proof\u201d modules in future quantum networks, without requiring cavities, feedback, or non\u2010linear elements.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Both qutrit swapping and linear-optical entanglement\u2010witness circuits have been previously demonstrated. Merging them into one architecture is an incremental integration rather than a new quantum\u2010network target. To be PRL-worthy you\u2019d need a truly new measurement primitive or an unexpected nontrivial interplay between distribution and certification.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It stays within linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors.  \n  2) This leans too far toward a computing task (DJ algorithm) and would need feed-forward to succeed deterministically\u2014Pytheus cannot handle that.  \n  3) Small QFT on one qubit is trivial and effectively state generation; also borderline computing.  \nStep 3: The \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d (idea #1) is both novel and fully implementable by Pytheus.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus targets define a multiport that simultaneously performs entanglement swapping and extracts an entanglement\u2010witness expectation in a single nonadaptive measurement. It elevates the Bell\u2010measurement block to a richer primitive that both distributes and certifies entanglement.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses abstract photonic modes, beam splitters, phase shifters, ancillary photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors; it does not require feedback or physical encodings. Pytheus can optimize the unitary transformation and ancilla pattern to realize both the swapping projector and the witness operator in one fused network.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose a \u201cSwap-and-Witness Analyzer\u201d\u2014a single linear-optical network that takes two independent Bell\u2010pair sources (four input photons) plus ancillary photons, and by a suitably optimized multiport performs:\n  1.

It uses only linear optics + pair\u2010sources + ancilla + detectors, so it is in Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.  \n    2) Phase estimation network is effectively state generation of a small Fourier state, too close to state prep.  \n    3) Parity is trivial, not a \u201ccomplex\u201d enough algorithmic primitive.  \n  Step 3: Select idea #1: the CNOT\u2010and\u2010Witness Analyzer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No prior Pytheus target fuses a nontrivial two\u2010qubit gate teleportation (CNOT) with an in\u2010line entanglement witness measurement into one nonadaptive linear\u2010optical network. This opens a family of \u201calgorithm+certification\u201d building blocks for photonic quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It invokes only abstract beam\u2010splitter arrays, probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can optimize the multiport unitary so that one subset of detectors heralds a successful teleported CNOT, while another subset\u2019s coincidence statistics directly give \u27e8W\u27e9 for a chosen witness (e.g. CHSH witness) on the post-CNOT output.

Simply cascading them into a single post\u2010selected network does not produce a novel quantum\u2010network primitive.

This defines a new fused\u2010measurement primitive for quantum networks.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: It only uses abstract photonic modes, two Bell\u2010pair sources, four ancilla photons, static beam splitters + phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. Pytheus can treat the entire target as \u201cproject onto Fock patterns P\u2081,P\u2082\u201d (the joint subspace) and find an optimal multiport without any forbidden hardware or feedback.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a \u201cCNOT\u00d7CHSH Fused Analyzer\u201d as a new Pytheus target: one static linear\u2010optical network that\u2014given two Bell\u2010pair sources and four ancilla photons\u2014performs in a single post\u2010selected measurement both\n  a) a teleportation\u2010based CNOT gate on two unknown qubits,\n  b) a CHSH\u2010type entanglement witness on the teleported outputs.\n\nKey idea:  \n\u2022 Instead of cascading a CNOT\u2010teleportation block and then a separate CHSH\u2010witness block, we define one joint projector onto the 8\u2010mode Fock subspace spanned by two specific click\u2010patterns P\u2081,P\u2082. Each pattern simultaneously signals \u201cCNOT succeeded\u201d and \u201cCHSH\u2010beat threshold.\u201d  \n\u2022 This fused measurement cannot be decomposed into two independent subcircuits; it exploits interference between gate\u2010ancillas and witness\u2010ancillas.\n\nGeneral structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n1.

INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS\nALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. \u2013 PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM. (LOOK AT THE FEEDBACK RECORD, WE EXPLAINED IT IN MANY CASES!! LOOK AT THE \u2018LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\u2019 WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)\n",
    "output": "We propose a \u201cMeasurement\u2010Device\u2010Independent Entanglement\u2010Witness via Fused Swap\u2010Analyzer\u201d as a new Pytheus target.  \n\nGoal:  \n  In a three\u2010node network\u2014Alice, Bob (the two remote parties), and an untrusted central node Charlie\u2014certify that Alice & Bob share entanglement without trusting any local measurement devices. Charlie\u2019s node performs one static linear\u2010optical multiport measurement that simultaneously  \n   1) SWAPS entanglement from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources into Alice\u2013Bob,  \n   2) PROJECTS onto an entanglement\u2010witness subspace so that Charlie\u2019s single\u2010shot click pattern directly yields the witness expectation \u27e8W\u27e9<0 \u21d4 entangled.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s new:  \n  \u2022 It fuses two primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (MDI\u2010QKD style) and entanglement witnessing\u2014into one irreducible multiport POVM. You cannot decompose the circuit into a \u201cswap\u2010block\u201d plus a \u201cwitness\u2010block\u201d without ruining the device\u2010independence property.  \n  \u2022 It delivers a genuine MDI-witness: Alice and Bob need only send their photons to Charlie and report \u201cphoton arrived\u201d events; they never trust their local analyzers. All the certification is done by Charlie\u2019s fused multiport.  \n  \u2022 By picking different witness operators (CHSH-type, high-dimensional Schmidt-number witnesses) or higher-D sources (qutrit pairs), one obtains a whole family of MDI-Witness analyzers.  \n\nNetwork sketch (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1. Sources:  \n     \u2022 S\u2081 emits a Bell pair into modes A\u2081\u2192Alice, C\u2081\u2192Charlie  \n     \u2022 S\u2082 emits a Bell pair into modes B\u2081\u2192Bob,  C\u2082\u2192Charlie  \n  2. Charlie injects two ancilla photons in modes X,Y.  \n  3. Static interferometer U (beam\u2010splitters + phase\u2010shifters) mixes modes [C\u2081,C\u2082,X,Y].  \n  4. Detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083 at Charlie record four\u2010mode click patterns. Two special patterns P\u208a,P\u208b are chosen so that  \n       \u2013 P\u208a\u21dd heralds successful entanglement swap & yields +1 outcome for the witness  \n       \u2013 P\u208b\u21dd heralds successful entanglement swap & yields \u20131 outcome  \n     All other patterns are discarded.  \n  5. From the relative frequency of P\u208b vs P\u208a in the post\u2010selected data one directly computes Tr[W\u2009\u03c1_{AB}]; if \u27e8W\u27e9<0 then Alice & Bob share entanglement.  \n\nPytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  'description':  \n    'MDI entanglement witness: fused swap + witness analyzer at central node',\n  'foldername': 'MDI_Witness',\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-06,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 2,\n  'samples': 10,\n  'target_patterns': ['1100','0011'],   # P\u208a and P\u208b\n  'removed_connections': [[0,3],[1,2]], # forbid direct Alice\u2194Bob sources\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nWhy Pytheus\u2010feasible & interesting:\n  \u2022 Everything is abstract: specify two Bell\u2010pair sources + 2 ancillas + 4 output detectors.  \n  \u2022 No feedback, no cavities, no state\u2010generation hardware; purely linear optics + ancillas + detectors.  \n  \u2022 The fused POVM is novel: entanglement\u2010swapping and entanglement\u2010witness are inextricably combined, giving true measurement\u2010device\u2010independence.  \n  \u2022 Generalizes to high dimensions, different witness forms, larger networks\u2014opening a family of MDI\u2010Witness modules for future quantum\u2010network architectures."
