Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to marry “variational quantum algorithm” and “non-Gaussian state” in a Pytheus-compatible network (no state‐generation targets, only network/measurements).
  1) Variational Entanglement Swapping: Use non-Gaussian ancillas (single-photon Fock inputs) at the central node. Introduce tunable linear-optics parameters that are classically optimized (variational loop) to maximize entanglement fidelity between the two end nodes.
  2) Variational Teleportation Basis Search: Teleport an unknown qudit by consuming a non-Gaussian ancilla (e.g. single-photon or two-photon Fock superposition) and optimizing the joint measurement network parameters to maximize teleportation fidelity for a chosen ensemble of inputs.
  3) Variational Network Routing: In a small triangle network of three nodes, inject non-Gaussian ancilla photons at each node and variationally optimize the network beamsplitter phases so that entanglement can be end-to-end routed along any chosen link on demand.

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
 1) None of the explored experiments use non-Gaussian ancillas or variational parameter search. Pytheus can encode Fock states abstractly and optimize linear networks, so this is feasible.
 2) The teleportation idea is very similar in spirit but it would be a one-node measurement optimization; less network-y.
 3) The routing idea is more complex; potential scalability issues and more ancillas.

Step 3: Pick #1, Variational Entanglement Swapping, as most promising.
Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has combined a variational search over a linear-optics measurement network with the explicit use of non-Gaussian ancilla states (single-photon Fock inputs) to optimize entanglement swapping fidelity.
Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because Pytheus can:
  • encode two Bell-pair sources plus single-photon ancilla sources abstractly,
  • optimize the network of beamsplitters/phases (variational parameters) to implement a joint measurement,
  • handle heralding detectors for the ancillas and output detectors for the end nodes,
  • produce a blueprint for the experiment without feedback loops or cavities.

Proposed Target: Variational Non-Gaussian Entanglement Swapping Network

Explanation:
We consider three parties: Alice (A), Bob (B), and Charlie (C). Alice–Bob and Bob–Charlie each share an abstract Bell pair (two probabilistic pair sources). In addition, Bob has k single-photon emitters (ancilla non-Gaussian resources). All photons travel through a single linear-optics network at Bob’s node, consisting of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters. At the output of this network, Bob performs number-resolving detections on all k+2 modes: k ancilla modes (heralding detectors) and the two “swap” modes that initially carried the halves of the two Bell pairs.

By conditioning on particular ancilla detection patterns (herald outcomes), an entangled state is projected onto the remaining two photons held by Alice and Charlie. The linear-optics network parameters define a family of generalized swap measurements; we wrap a classical variational loop around Pytheus to adjust these parameters so as to maximize:
   – the concurrence (or fidelity to a target Bell state) between Alice and Charlie for a chosen heralding event.

  Output: Alice & Charlie share optimized entanglement

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  • It creates a new class of “variational measurements” in quantum networks—measurement bases are not fixed Bell-measurements but are optimized non-Gaussian-ancilla-assisted projections.
  • The same idea generalizes to higher dimensions (qutrit Bell states + multi-photon ancillas) and to multi-node chains (entanglement routing).
  • Independently of implementation, the theory of variational network-assisted entanglement swapping could yield new fundamental bounds on non-Gaussian resource requirements for repeater chains.

Pytheus Implementation Outline:
  – Abstract inputs: target that maps 
       {BellPair_AB, BellPair_BC, k Fock-states |1⟩} 
    → detection patterns consistent with a high-fidelity entangled output on designated “Alice” and “Charlie” output nodes.
  – Free parameters: edge reflectivities and phase shifts in Bob’s subnetwork.
  – Ancilla detectors: herald on k single-photon modes.
  – Out detectors: two designated modes produce the swapped entangled pair.
  – Loss function: 1 – fidelity(A,C to |Φ⁺⟩).
  – Optimizer: e.g. L-BFGS-B on continuous optical parameters.

This target will drive Pytheus to find a novel ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit that best realizes entanglement swapping under non-Gaussian resource constraints, opening up a new avenue at the interface between variational quantum algorithms and non-Gaussian quantum networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal genuinely introduces a new paradigm—“variational measurements” in entanglement swapping—by using ancilla single photons and a tunable linear‐optical network whose parameters are optimized to maximize performance. None of the listed experiments or ensemble ideas employ a classical variational loop to design the Bell‐swap measurement itself. This goes beyond static, fixed‐basis Bell analyzers or specific non‐Hermitian/PT‐symmetric projectors; it promises a systematic way to discover optimal non-Gaussian swap measurements and to chart fundamental resource–performance trade‐offs. As a target for Pytheus, it is both conceptually and technically fresh and could yield circuits and bounds the community hasn’t seen. Action: accept Action Input: I find this variational, ancilla‐assisted swap measurement framework sufficiently novel and publishable (PRL‐worthy). It opens a new avenue at the intersection of photonic networks, non‐Gaussian resources, and variational design, offering both concrete circuit proposals and fundamental insights into resource requirements.
