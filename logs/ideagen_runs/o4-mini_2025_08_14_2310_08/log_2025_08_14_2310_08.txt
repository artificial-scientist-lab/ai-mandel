    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3.

It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k.

By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

Superposition\u2010of\u2010teleportation\u2010routes \u201cquantum router\u201d is genuinely new: it is not mere state generation but a novel network transformation, requires no dynamic control, uses only pair sources, beamsplitters, and heralding.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (3).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus target implements teleportation with coherent superposition of the teleportation destination\u2014it elevates a static swap network into a true quantum\u2010routing primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we can encode:\n    \u2022 Two spin\u2013photon Bell\u2010pair sources on chip (coherent light\u2013matter interfaces).  \n    \u2022 A static linear\u2010optics circuit that splits the \u201cBell\u2010measurement\u201d arm into two identical analyzers (one coupling to node B\u2019s ancilla photon, one to C\u2019s).  \n    \u2022 Post\u2010selected ancilla detectors heralding a successful teleportation, with no feed\u2010forward needed.  \n    \u2022 Abstract qubit encoding so Pytheus finds beam splitter phases and coupling to realize the target mapping.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target configuration\u2014an integrated \u201cquantum\u2010router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit from node A to B or C in coherent superposition, heralded by post-selected photonic detection:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label three stationary spin qubits on chip: A (mode 0), B (mode 1), C (mode 2). Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip. Each block has two ancilla detectors (modes 6,7 for B-branch and modes 8,9 for C-branch). A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C.

By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Such spin\u2013photon mediated entanglement swapping has already been demonstrated in NV centers, quantum dots, and other platforms (e.g. Moehring et al. Nature 2007; Bernien et al.

There is no new foundational feature, multi-node network effect, or higher-dimensional twist that would elevate this to PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers. To be novel at the PRL level, you would need to introduce a genuinely new element\u2014e.g. an indefinite\u2010order swap, a heralded multi-qubit fusion primitive that cannot be reduced to standard swapping, or integration of nonclassical ancilla conservation that goes beyond straightforward photonic routing.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is the proposed target configuration\u2014an integrated \u201cquantum\u2010router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit from node A to B or C in coherent superposition, heralded by post-selected photonic detection:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label three stationary spin qubits on chip: A (mode 0), B (mode 1), C (mode 2).

A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes.

Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Purification is genuinely new for Pytheus: it implements a network transformation beyond swap/teleport, uses only probabilistic pair sources and linear optics, no dynamic feedback, and can be generalized to multiple rounds.\n  Step 3: Choose idea (3).\n  Step 4: Novelty: No previous Pytheus target performs entanglement purification on coherent\u2010light\u2010matter qubit memories via an on\u2010chip parity\u2010check circuit. This extends network protocols into error\u2010mitigation.\n  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can encode two abstract Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a passive integrated beam\u2010splitter parity network on the two photons, and two ancilla detectors for post\u2010selection. No cavities or feed\u2010forward are needed.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target\u2014an integrated\u2010photonic entanglement\u2010purification primitive for two spin qubits, using coherent light\u2013matter interfaces and linear optics:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label two stationary spin\u2010qubit nodes on chip: Q\u2081 (mode 0) and Q\u2082 (mode 1). Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each generate a (noisy) abstract Bell pair:\n \u2022 S\u2081 produces entanglement between spin 0 and photon mode 2.  \n \u2022 S\u2082 produces entanglement between spin 1 and photon mode 3.  \n\nThese two raw spin\u2013photon Bell pairs suffer dephasing or imperfect fidelity. We wish to purify them into a single higher\u2010fidelity spin\u2013spin Bell pair on nodes 0&1. To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome. Conditioned on one click in each detector (post\u2010selection), the remaining spins collapse into a purified Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates on\u2010chip entanglement purification of matter qubit memories.\n\nVisualization (modes top\u2192bottom):\nemitters:    [S\u2081:(0\u21942)]   [S\u2082:(1\u21943)]  \nparity\u2010circuit:  [BS(2,3) + phase network]  \ndetectors:   [spin-read@0][spin-read@1][anc@4][anc@5]\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description         : \"On-chip entanglement purification of two spin qubits via photonic parity check\",\n  foldername          : \"spin_purification_chip\",\n  edges_tried         : 25,\n  ftol                : 1e-06,\n  loss_func           : \"cr\",\n  num_anc             : 2,               # detectors 4 & 5\n  optimizer           : \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples             : 10,\n  target_quantum      : [\"00\",\"11\"],     # purified spin pair on nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes            : [],  \n  out_nodes           : [0,1],\n  single_emitters     : [],  \n  amplitudes          : [],\n  removed_connections : [],  \n  anc_detectors       : [4,5],\n  number_resolving    : true\n}\n\nGeneralizations:\n \u2013 Cascaded purification: chain multiple rounds by feeding in additional raw pairs.  \n \u2013 Multipartite purification: extend to three or more spins via multi-photon parity checks.  \n \u2013 Forms a building block for on-chip error mitigation in scalable photonic\u2013matter quantum networks."

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3).

Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

At each node we have a coherent light\u2013matter interface that probabilistically emits a photon entangled with the local spin:  \n \u2022 S\u2081: Bell\u2010pair between spin A(0) \u2194 photon 4  \n \u2022 S\u2082: Bell\u2010pair between spin B(1) \u2194 photon 5  \n \u2022 S\u2083: Bell\u2010pair between spin C(2) \u2194 photon 6  \n \u2022 S\u2084: Bell\u2010pair between spin D(3) \u2194 photon 7  \n\nOur goal is to re\u2010distribute these two initial Bell pairs  \n   (A\u20134 & C\u20136)  \n   (B\u20135 & D\u20137)  \nso that after the network coding operation we end up with two new Bell pairs  \n   (A\u20132)  and  (B\u20133)  \n(i.e. entanglement A\u2194C and B\u2194D)  \nwhile having only a single two\u2010mode \u201cbottleneck\u201d that carries photons 5 & 6 through a single 50\u223650 beam splitter.  The rest of the circuit fans out these modes to two Bell\u2010analyzers on the output pairs.  \n\nCircuit sketch (top\u2192bottom):  \nemitters:  \n   [S\u2081:(0\u21944)]  [S\u2082:(1\u21945)]  [S\u2083:(2\u21946)]  [S\u2084:(3\u21947)]  \nintegrated routing:  \n   \u2013 Photons 5 & 6 are the only ones sharing the \u201cbottleneck\u201d beam splitter BS\u2081.  \n   \u2013 After BS\u2081, the two output modes of that BS each go into one of two separate Bell\u2010measurement blocks:  \n       \u2022 Block X measures (4 & output_of_BS\u2081_port1) \u2192 heralds entanglement A\u2013C  \n       \u2022 Block Y measures (7 & output_of_BS\u2081_port2) \u2192 heralds entanglement B\u2013D  \nEach Bell block is a second 50\u223650 BS plus two number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n\nDetection & post\u2010selection:  \nWe require exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors (two detectors per Bell block).  Conditioned on these 4 clicks, the two spin\u2010pairs (A,C) and (B,D) collapse into their respective Bell states.  \n\nWhy this is interesting & novel:  \n \u2022 This is *not* two independent entanglement swaps\u2014both entanglement flows share a single physical beam splitter (\u201cbottleneck\u201d).  This implements the *quantum analog of the classical butterfly network code*.  \n \u2022 It directly combines coherent light\u2013matter pair sources (four spin\u2013photon Bell pairs) with an on\u2010chip integrated photonic circuit that *mixes* two optical channels in superposition.  \n \u2022 No dynamic feed\u2010forward or cavities: purely probabilistic pair sources + static beam splitters + post\u2010selected detection.  \n \u2022 The same design can be extended to larger network\u2010coding primitives (more sources, more flow\u2010crossings) or to higher\u2010dimensional systems.  \n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:  \n{  \n  description        : \"On\u2010chip quantum network coding (butterfly) for two Bell\u2010pairs\",  \n  foldername         : \"butterfly_network_code\",  \n  edges_tried        : 25,  \n  ftol               : 1e-06,  \n  loss_func          : \"cr\",  \n  num_anc            : 4,               # detectors in two Bell\u2010blocks  \n  optimizer          : \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  samples            : 12,  \n  target_quantum     : [\"00\",\"11\",\"00\",\"11\"],  # final Bell\u2010pairs on spins [0,2] and [1,3]  \n  in_nodes           : [],  \n  out_nodes          : [0,2,1,3],  \n  single_emitters    : [],  \n  amplitudes         : [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  anc_detectors      : [8,9,10,11],     # four ancilla detectors  \n  number_resolving   : true  \n}  \n\nMode\u2010index mapping:  \n  spins:      0(A),1(B),2(C),3(D)  \n  photons in: 4(S\u2081),5(S\u2082),6(S\u2083),7(S\u2084)  \n  ancilla det:8,9 (Bell\u2010block X), 10,11 (Bell\u2010block Y)  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2013 Replace the single bottleneck BS with a larger interferometer to code N flows through M < N channels.  \n\u2013 Move beyond qubits to qutrit\u2010network coding by upgrading S\u2096 sources.  \n\nThis circuit gives a first experimental blueprint for *quantum network coding* in an integrated photonic + matter\u2010qubit setting, well within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

On\u2010chip entanglement swapping of two spin qubits via a linear\u2010optics Bell\u2010analyzer (spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 spin\u2013spin Bell).\n    2. A two\u2010segment repeater chain: teleport spin A\u2192spin C via spin B on chip, using two chained post\u2010selected Bell measurements.\n    3. On\u2010chip entanglement purification of two noisy spin memories: generate two spin\u2013photon pairs, interfere their photons in an integrated circuit to perform a parity check, and post\u2010select to herald a purified spin\u2013spin Bell pair.\n  Step 2: Evaluate novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Too close to earlier spin\u2013photon swap proposals.\n    2. Basically two sequential swaps\u2014interesting but expected.\n    3. Purification is genuinely new for Pytheus: it implements a network transformation beyond swap/teleport, uses only probabilistic pair sources and linear optics, no dynamic feedback, and can be generalized to multiple rounds.\n  Step 3: Choose idea (3).\n  Step 4: Novelty: No previous Pytheus target performs entanglement purification on coherent\u2010light\u2010matter qubit memories via an on\u2010chip parity\u2010check circuit. This extends network protocols into error\u2010mitigation.\n  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can encode two abstract Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a passive integrated beam\u2010splitter parity network on the two photons, and two ancilla detectors for post\u2010selection. No cavities or feed\u2010forward are needed.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target\u2014an integrated\u2010photonic entanglement\u2010purification primitive for two spin qubits, using coherent light\u2013matter interfaces and linear optics:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label two stationary spin\u2010qubit nodes on chip: Q\u2081 (mode 0) and Q\u2082 (mode 1). Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each generate a (noisy) abstract Bell pair:\n \u2022 S\u2081 produces entanglement between spin 0 and photon mode 2.  \n \u2022 S\u2082 produces entanglement between spin 1 and photon mode 3.  \n\nThese two raw spin\u2013photon Bell pairs suffer dephasing or imperfect fidelity. We wish to purify them into a single higher\u2010fidelity spin\u2013spin Bell pair on nodes 0&1. To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome. Conditioned on one click in each detector (post\u2010selection), the remaining spins collapse into a purified Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates on\u2010chip entanglement purification of matter qubit memories.\n\nVisualization (modes top\u2192bottom):\nemitters:    [S\u2081:(0\u21942)]   [S\u2082:(1\u21943)]  \nparity\u2010circuit:  [BS(2,3) + phase network]  \ndetectors:   [spin-read@0][spin-read@1][anc@4][anc@5]\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description         : \"On-chip entanglement purification of two spin qubits via photonic parity check\",\n  foldername          : \"spin_purification_chip\",\n  edges_tried         : 25,\n  ftol                : 1e-06,\n  loss_func           : \"cr\",\n  num_anc             : 2,               # detectors 4 & 5\n  optimizer           : \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples             : 10,\n  target_quantum      : [\"00\",\"11\"],     # purified spin pair on nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes            : [],  \n  out_nodes           : [0,1],\n  single_emitters     : [],  \n  amplitudes          : [],\n  removed_connections : [],  \n  anc_detectors       : [4,5],\n  number_resolving    : true\n}\n\nGeneralizations:\n \u2013 Cascaded purification: chain multiple rounds by feeding in additional raw pairs.  \n \u2013 Multipartite purification: extend to three or more spins via multi-photon parity checks.  \n \u2013 Forms a building block for on-chip error mitigation in scalable photonic\u2013matter quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to known entanglement purification protocols (including on-chip qutrit purification and passive Bell-filter networks) and offers no fundamentally new element.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k.

By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node.

By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection.

Such spin\u2013photon mediated entanglement swapping has already been demonstrated in NV centers, quantum dots, and other platforms (e.g. Moehring et al. Nature 2007; Bernien et al.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"coherent light matter interaction\" and \"integrated photonic circuit\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1.

Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

On\u2010chip entanglement swapping of two quantum\u2010dot spins via an integrated linear\u2010optics Bell\u2010analyzer (spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 spin\u2013spin Bell).\n    2. A two\u2010node repeater teleportation segment: teleport a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from node A to node C via an intermediate spin memory B, all on chip, using two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs and chained post-selected Bell measurements.\n    3. A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Too close to existing hybrid swap protocols (and prior photonic Bell analyzers).\n    2. Essentially a chained swap; interesting but conceptually expected.\n    3. Superposition\u2010of\u2010teleportation\u2010routes \u201cquantum router\u201d is genuinely new: it is not mere state generation but a novel network transformation, requires no dynamic control, uses only pair sources, beamsplitters, and heralding.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (3).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus target implements teleportation with coherent superposition of the teleportation destination\u2014it elevates a static swap network into a true quantum\u2010routing primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we can encode:\n    \u2022 Two spin\u2013photon Bell\u2010pair sources on chip (coherent light\u2013matter interfaces).  \n    \u2022 A static linear\u2010optics circuit that splits the \u201cBell\u2010measurement\u201d arm into two identical analyzers (one coupling to node B\u2019s ancilla photon, one to C\u2019s).  \n    \u2022 Post\u2010selected ancilla detectors heralding a successful teleportation, with no feed\u2010forward needed.  \n    \u2022 Abstract qubit encoding so Pytheus finds beam splitter phases and coupling to realize the target mapping.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target configuration\u2014an integrated \u201cquantum\u2010router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit from node A to B or C in coherent superposition, heralded by post-selected photonic detection:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label three stationary spin qubits on chip: A (mode 0), B (mode 1), C (mode 2).

We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

On\u2010chip entanglement swapping of two quantum\u2010dot spins via an integrated linear\u2010optics Bell\u2010analyzer (spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 spin\u2013spin Bell).\n    2. A two\u2010node repeater teleportation segment: teleport a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from node A to node C via an intermediate spin memory B, all on chip, using two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs and chained post-selected Bell measurements.\n    3. A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Too close to existing hybrid swap protocols (and prior photonic Bell analyzers).\n    2. Essentially a chained swap; interesting but conceptually expected.\n    3. Superposition\u2010of\u2010teleportation\u2010routes \u201cquantum router\u201d is genuinely new: it is not mere state generation but a novel network transformation, requires no dynamic control, uses only pair sources, beamsplitters, and heralding.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (3).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus target implements teleportation with coherent superposition of the teleportation destination\u2014it elevates a static swap network into a true quantum\u2010routing primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we can encode:\n    \u2022 Two spin\u2013photon Bell\u2010pair sources on chip (coherent light\u2013matter interfaces).  \n    \u2022 A static linear\u2010optics circuit that splits the \u201cBell\u2010measurement\u201d arm into two identical analyzers (one coupling to node B\u2019s ancilla photon, one to C\u2019s).  \n    \u2022 Post\u2010selected ancilla detectors heralding a successful teleportation, with no feed\u2010forward needed.  \n    \u2022 Abstract qubit encoding so Pytheus finds beam splitter phases and coupling to realize the target mapping.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target configuration\u2014an integrated \u201cquantum\u2010router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit from node A to B or C in coherent superposition, heralded by post-selected photonic detection:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label three stationary spin qubits on chip: A (mode 0), B (mode 1), C (mode 2).

We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"coherent light matter interaction\" and \"integrated photonic circuit\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1.

Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels.

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters).

Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each generate a (noisy) abstract Bell pair:\n \u2022 S\u2081 produces entanglement between spin 0 and photon mode 2.  \n \u2022 S\u2082 produces entanglement between spin 1 and photon mode 3.  \n\nThese two raw spin\u2013photon Bell pairs suffer dephasing or imperfect fidelity. We wish to purify them into a single higher\u2010fidelity spin\u2013spin Bell pair on nodes 0&1. To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome. Conditioned on one click in each detector (post\u2010selection), the remaining spins collapse into a purified Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3).

Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"coherent light matter interaction\" and \"integrated photonic circuit\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1.

Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

This is not mere state generation but a nontrivial routing transformation: two senders teleport qubits through a single physical \u201cbottleneck\u201d waveguide by performing network\u2010coded Bell measurements in an integrated circuit. Such a protocol hasn\u2019t appeared in the existing Pytheus corpus, combines the two required concepts, and uses only Bell\u2010pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and post-selected detectors\u2014no cavities or dynamic feed-forward.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target\u2014an integrated\u2010photonic butterfly network\u2010coding teleportation experiment:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four on-chip spin-qubit nodes:\n \u2022 S\u2081 (mode 0)  \n \u2022 S\u2082 (mode 1)  \n \u2022 R\u2081 (mode 2)  \n \u2022 R\u2082 (mode 3)\n\nFour coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each emit an abstract Bell pair between a spin and a photon:\n \u2022 Source A: Qubit 0\u2194Photon 4  \n \u2022 Source B: Qubit 1\u2194Photon 5  \n \u2022 Source C: Qubit 2\u2194Photon 6  \n \u2022 Source D: Qubit 3\u2194Photon 7  \n\nGoal:\nSimultaneously teleport unknown states |\u03c8\u27e9\u2080 and |\u03d5\u27e9\u2081 from senders S\u2081,S\u2082 to receivers R\u2081,R\u2082\u2014in spite of having only one shared \u201cbottleneck\u201d waveguide link\u2014by performing a network\u2010coding version of teleportation in a static integrated circuit.\n\nIntegrated Circuit Layout:\n 1.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols.

Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k.

By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"coherent light matter interaction\" and \"integrated photonic circuit\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1.

Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

A pair of clicks in either the B-branch detectors or the C-branch detectors heralds successful teleportation to B or C, respectively\u2014but because the split was coherent, the teleportation destination remains in superposition until detection.

To do so, we interfere the two photons (modes 2,3) in an integrated parity\u2010check circuit: a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifter network that effectively implements a photonic parity measurement. Two number\u2010resolving detectors (modes 4 & 5) herald a successful even\u2010parity outcome.

Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps.

Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer).

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9. This demonstrates photonic-mediated entanglement swapping of matter qubits on chip.\n\nVisualization (modes going top\u2192bottom):\nemitters: [ S\u2081: (0\u21942) ]  [ S\u2082: (1\u21943) ]  \ncircuit: [ waveguide routing 2 & 3 into 50:50 BS + phase shifter network ]  \ndetectors: [spin-readout@0][spin-readout@1][detector@2][detector@3][ancilla@4][ancilla@5]\n\nKey points:\n  \u2013 No dynamic feed-forward: success is post-selected by ancilla clicks.\n  \u2013 Coherent light\u2013matter interaction enters via the two initial Bell-pair sources.\n  \u2013 Entire Bell-measurement circuit and routing is realized in an integrated photonic waveguide architecture.\n  \u2013 The target is the abstract transformation: two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 post-selected spin\u2013spin Bell pair (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9).\n  \u2013 This protocol can be generalized to multiple nodes (linear repeater chains or networks with star/topologies).\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description: \"On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits via photonic Bell-measurement\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid_spin_swap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.0,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 12,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # spin nodes 0 & 1\n  in_nodes: [],                       # pair sources define inputs\n  out_nodes: [0,1],\n  heralding_out: null,\n  single_emitters: [],                # abstract pair sources instead\n  amplitudes: [],\n  removed_connections: [],            # allow all routing\n  anc_detectors: [4,5],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to existing spin\u2013photon entanglement-swapping experiments and on-chip Bell analyzers.

On\u2010chip entanglement swapping of two quantum\u2010dot spins via an integrated linear\u2010optics Bell\u2010analyzer (spin\u2013photon Bell pairs \u2192 spin\u2013spin Bell).\n    2. A two\u2010node repeater teleportation segment: teleport a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from node A to node C via an intermediate spin memory B, all on chip, using two spin\u2013photon Bell pairs and chained post-selected Bell measurements.\n    3. A \u201cquantum router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit\u2019s state from A to either B or C, but in a coherent superposition of destinations, by using an on\u2010chip photonic network that splits the Bell\u2010measurement in two branches and recombines them\u2014no feedback, purely post-selected.\n  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Too close to existing hybrid swap protocols (and prior photonic Bell analyzers).\n    2. Essentially a chained swap; interesting but conceptually expected.\n    3. Superposition\u2010of\u2010teleportation\u2010routes \u201cquantum router\u201d is genuinely new: it is not mere state generation but a novel network transformation, requires no dynamic control, uses only pair sources, beamsplitters, and heralding.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (3).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus target implements teleportation with coherent superposition of the teleportation destination\u2014it elevates a static swap network into a true quantum\u2010routing primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we can encode:\n    \u2022 Two spin\u2013photon Bell\u2010pair sources on chip (coherent light\u2013matter interfaces).  \n    \u2022 A static linear\u2010optics circuit that splits the \u201cBell\u2010measurement\u201d arm into two identical analyzers (one coupling to node B\u2019s ancilla photon, one to C\u2019s).  \n    \u2022 Post\u2010selected ancilla detectors heralding a successful teleportation, with no feed\u2010forward needed.  \n    \u2022 Abstract qubit encoding so Pytheus finds beam splitter phases and coupling to realize the target mapping.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed target configuration\u2014an integrated \u201cquantum\u2010router\u201d that teleports a spin\u2010qubit from node A to B or C in coherent superposition, heralded by post-selected photonic detection:\n\nExplanation:\nWe label three stationary spin qubits on chip: A (mode 0), B (mode 1), C (mode 2). Two coherent light\u2013matter interfaces each produce an abstract Bell pair:\n  \u2022 S\u2081: entangles spin A (0) with photonic mode 3.  \n  \u2022 S\u2082: entangles spin B (1) with photonic mode 4.  \n  \u2022 S\u2083: entangles spin C (2) with photonic mode 5.  \n\nWe wish to teleport an arbitrary input state |\u03c8\u27e9 on spin A to either B or C, but in a controlled superposition. We build an integrated photonic circuit that routes mode 3 equally into two Bell\u2010measurement blocks:\n  \u2013 Block 1 jointly measures modes (3 & 4) to teleport to B.\n  \u2013 Block 2 jointly measures modes (3 & 5) to teleport to C.\n\nA 50:50 directional coupler splits mode 3 into paths to both blocks; the two Bell\u2010analyzers are realized with beam splitters and phase shifters on chip.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: New Aspects of Optical Coherence and their Potential for Quantum\n  Technologies\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Scalable entanglement certification via quantum communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On-chip entanglement swapping between two spin qubits in quantum dots, mediated by integrated photonic Bell-state measurement of their emitted photons.\n  2. A two-node repeater segment: teleportation of a photonic qubit across an integrated waveguide link using two quantum-dot spin memories as intermediate nodes.\n  3. A triangular three-node network: each node is a spin qubit coherently interacting with on-chip waveguides; photons shuttle entanglement around the triangle, realizing a photonic-mediated spin GHZ swap.\nStep 2: Checking novelty and obstacles:\n  1. Hybrid spin\u2013spin entanglement swapping is not in the existing list (which only does photon\u2013photon). Pytheus can handle abstract qubits and pair sources but cannot model cavities\u2014so we treat spin\u2013photon entangled pair sources abstractly.\n  2. The two-node repeater is similar to chained swapping but with two spin memories; more complex but feasible\u2014Pytheus cannot do feed-forward, so it must be post-selected teleportation.\n  3. The triangle GHZ swap is conceptually interesting but very complex; might exceed Pytheus\u2019s search space.\nStep 3: I choose option 1 as the most promising: it\u2019s a direct generalization of photon\u2013photon swapping to a hybrid network, requires no feedback control, and naturally sits on an integrated photonic chip with coherent light\u2013matter interfaces.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target has considered entanglement swapping between matter qubits via on-chip photonic Bell measurements. It extends known photon\u2013photon protocols into the hybrid domain.\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we can encode two Bell\u2010pair sources (spin\u2013photon), a linear-optics circuit on modes 2 & 3, and post-selected detectors mediating the swap. No cavities or dynamic feedback are required, only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors on chip.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is a fully specified target for Pytheus\u2014an on-chip, post-selected entanglement swap between two matter qubits mediated by an integrated photonic Bell-state analyzer.\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider two stationary spin qubits (e.g. quantum-dot exciton levels) on an integrated photonic chip, labelled nodes 0 and 1. Each spin is initially entangled with an emitted photon via a coherent light\u2013matter interaction on chip, realizing two independent Bell pairs:\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2081 emits an abstract Bell state between spin-mode 0 and photonic mode 2.\n  \u2022 Pair-source S\u2082 emits an identical Bell state between spin-mode 1 and photonic mode 3.\nThe two photons (modes 2 & 3) are routed by an integrated waveguide circuit into a linear-optics Bell-state measurement (BSM) block (a 50:50 beam splitter plus phase shifters). Successful BSM outcomes are heralded by two ancillary detectors (modes 4 & 5). Conditioned on a click in each ancilla detector (post-selection), the two remote spins (nodes 0 & 1) collapse into a maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.

Four coherent light\u2013matter interfaces prepare abstract qutrit-photonic Bell pairs:\n \u2022 Source A: Qutrit 0 \u2194 photon mode 4  \n \u2022 Source B: Qutrit 1 \u2194 photon mode 5  \n \u2022 Source C: Qutrit 2 \u2194 photon mode 6  \n \u2022 Source D: Qutrit 3 \u2194 photon mode 7  \n\nGoal:\nTeleport an unknown qutrit state |\u03c8\u27e9\u2080 from S\u2081 to R\u2081 and |\u03d5\u27e9\u2081 from S\u2082 to R\u2082, using only one three-mode photonic \u201cbottleneck\u201d (modes X,Y,Z) on chip.\n\nIntegrated photonic circuit:\n1. Photons 4 & 5 enter a 3\u00d73 symmetric tritter, whose three output modes (X, Y, Z) coherently mix both inputs plus a vacuum ancilla.  \n2. Outputs X and Y feed into a three-dimensional Bell-state analyzer at R\u2081: a set of beam splitters and phase shifts implementing the qutrit Bell measurement on (X,6), with ancilla detectors 8,9,10.  \n3. Outputs X and Z feed into a second qutrit Bell-analyzer at R\u2082: the same 3\u00d73 interferometer structure acting on (Y,7), with ancilla detectors 11,12,13.\n\nBecause of the tritter\u2019s coherent mixing, each receiver\u2019s analyzer effectively performs the network-coded teleportation of its sender\u2019s qutrit, despite sharing only the three output modes {X,Y,Z}. A successful pair of clicks at {8,9,10} heralds |\u03c8\u27e9 at R\u2081; clicks at {11,12,13} herald |\u03d5\u27e9 at R\u2082.\n\nVisualization (modes top\u2192bottom):\nemitters:    [S\u2081:(0\u21944)]  [S\u2082:(1\u21945)]  [R\u2081:(2\u21946)]  [R\u2082:(3\u21947)]  \ntritter:     [3\u00d73 multiport mixing inputs 4,5, vacuum \u2192 outputs X,Y,Z]  \nanalyzer R\u2081: [3-mode BS+phase on (X,6,vac) \u2192 anc8,9,10]  \nanalyzer R\u2082: [3-mode BS+phase on (Y,7,vac) \u2192 anc11,12,13]  \ndetectors:   [spin\u2010read@0][spin\u2010read@1][spin\u2010read@2][spin\u2010read@3][anc8\u2026anc13]\n\nSkeleton Pytheus config:\n{\n  description         : \"3D butterfly network-coding teleportation of two qutrits\",\n  foldername          : \"3d_butterfly_qnc\",\n  edges_tried         : 40,\n  ftol                : 1e-06,\n  loss_func           : \"cr\",\n  num_anc             : 6,                  # detectors 8\u201313\n  optimizer           : \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples             : 15,\n  target_quantum      : [\"\u03c8@2\",\"\u03d5@3\"],      # teleport outputs on nodes 2 & 3\n  in_nodes            : [],\n  out_nodes           : [2,3],\n  single_emitters     : [],\n  amplitudes          : [],\n  removed_connections : [],  \n  anc_detectors       : [8,9,10,11,12,13],\n  number_resolving    : true\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 First high-dimensional (qutrit) network-coding teleportation on chip\u2014no 2D restriction.  \n \u2022 Combines coherent light\u2013matter interfaces (qutrit memories) with an integrated tritter and linear-optics Bell analyzers.  \n \u2022 Demonstrates true network coding: two independent qutrit teleportations through one physical 3-mode channel.  \n \u2022 Generalizable to d-dimensional \u201cbutterfly\u201d coding, larger network-coding topologies (e.g. multicast, congestion-free routing), and to arbitrary graph networks in integrated photonics.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme duplicates the existing qudit\u2010butterfly network\u2010coding teleportation in a hybrid spin\u2013photon form without substantive innovation. To reach PRL novelty, propose a genuinely new network coding primitive (e.g. indefinite\u2010order or multi-party supermap in higher dimensions, nontrivial entanglement fusion beyond standard butterfly coding, or a topology-protected multiplexing that cannot be reduced to the known d-dimensional butterfly protocol).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "output": "Here is a proposal for a genuinely new network\u2010level primitive\u2014a heralded SWAP gate between two on\u2010chip spin qubits\u2014combining coherent light\u2013matter Bell\u2010pair sources with a passive integrated photonic circuit. This is not a state\u2010generation task but a two\u2013qubit gate (a network transformation) that routes quantum information between memories.\n\nExplanation:\nWe have two stationary spin\u2010qubit nodes on a single integrated photonic chip:\n \u2022 Q\u2080 (\u201cA\u201d)  \n \u2022 Q\u2081 (\u201cB\u201d)\n\nEach qubit is coherently entangled with an on\u2010chip photon via a light\u2013matter interface (e.g. a quantum\u2010dot emitter in a waveguide), realizing two abstract Bell\u2010pair sources:\n \u2022 S\u2081 emits Bell state between spin A (mode 0) and photonic mode 2.  \n \u2022 S\u2082 emits Bell state between spin B (mode 1) and photonic mode 3.\n\nGoal: implement the SWAP unitary Uswap\u2002|\u03c8\u27e9\u2080|\u03d5\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03d5\u27e9\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9\u2081, i.e. exchange the unknown quantum states of the two memories, by performing a single passive photonic measurement and post\u2010selecting on its outcome\u2014no dynamic feed\u2010forward.\n\nIntegrated photonic circuit:\n \u2022 Photonic modes 2 and 3 are routed into a small linear\u2010optics network (two 50:50 beam splitters plus adjustable phase shifters) that effectively implements the joint measurement needed to teleport A\u2192B and B\u2192A in one operation.  \n \u2022 Two ancilla photon\u2010counting detectors (modes 4 & 5) are placed at the two \u201cheralding\u201d ports of this network.  \n\nProcedure:\n 1. S\u2081 and S\u2082 each generate a spin\u2013photon Bell pair.  \n 2. Photons 2 and 3 enter the integrated circuit; a click in both detectors 4 and 5 heralds that the two memories have been swapped.  \n 3. Spins 0 and 1 are then found in swapped states; the network transformation is the SWAP gate.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 A SWAP gate is a fundamental network\u2010routing primitive (it permutes qubits between nodes) that goes beyond the usual entanglement\u2010generation targets.  \n \u2022 Combining coherent light\u2013matter Bell\u2010pair sources with a static photonic Bell\u2010measurement circuit shows how memories can talk to each other via light on chip.  \n \u2022 The same idea extends to multi\u2010node SWAP networks, reconfigurable routing fabrics, or higher\u2010dimensional permutation gates\u2014anywhere you need to permute quantum data in a network.\n\nSkeleton Pytheus configuration:\n{\n  description         : \"On\u2010chip heralded SWAP gate between two spin qubits via photonic Bell\u2010measurement\",\n  foldername          : \"spin_swap_gate\",\n  edges_tried         : 25,\n  ftol                : 1e-06,\n  loss_func           : \"cr\",\n  num_anc             : 2,                    # detectors 4 & 5\n  num_pre             : 1,\n  optimizer           : \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples             : 12,\n  target_quantum      : [\"00\u219200\",\"01\u219210\",\"10\u219201\",\"11\u219211\"],  # SWAP truth table\n  in_nodes            : [0,1],                # spin inputs\n  out_nodes           : [0,1],                # spin outputs\n  single_emitters     : [],  \n  amplitudes          : [],\n  removed_connections : [],  \n  anc_detectors       : [4,5],\n  number_resolving    : true\n}\n\nVisualization (modes top\u2192bottom):\nemitters:    [S\u2081: (0\u21942)]    [S\u2082: (1\u21943)]  \ncircuit:     [BS + phase network mixing 2 & 3]  \ndetectors:   [spin\u2010read@0][spin\u2010read@1][anc@4][anc@5]\n\nNo cavities or dynamic control are needed\u2014just pair sources, integrated waveguides, beam splitters, phase shifters and photon counters.
