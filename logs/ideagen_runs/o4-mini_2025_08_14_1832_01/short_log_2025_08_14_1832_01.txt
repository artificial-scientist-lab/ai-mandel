Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to connect “quantum internet” and “quantum photonic circuit” in a Pytheus‐compatible target:
    a) A photonic “quantum switch” that routes entanglement on demand between any two of four network ports, controlled by an ancilla photon—i.e. a controlled‐swap of entanglement pairs.
    b) A small “butterfly” quantum network coding module on a chip: two Bell‐pair sources share a single optical link via a linear‐optical network that implements quantum network coding, delivering two entangled links simultaneously over constrained resources.
    c) A dual‐channel entanglement repeater node in a photonic circuit that simultaneously swaps two adjacent Bell‐links in parallel, merging the two swap operations into one integrated interferometer to reduce ancilla overhead.
  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus obstacles:
    a) (“quantum switch”) Novel: no prior Pytheus experiment reconfigures entanglement topology in superposition. Pytheus can handle abstract multi‐photon states, linear optics, ancilla clicks, no dynamic feedback.
    b) (network coding) Interesting but network coding normally needs quantum memory and classical communication; Pytheus cannot model feed‐forward; might be too complex.
    c) (parallel repeater) Implements two simultaneous entanglement swappings; similar in spirit to “3pES” but only two swap operations fused—less novel.
  Step 3: Pick (a) “photonic quantum switch”—most novel, network‐centric, generalizable.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it marries the concept of a routing “switch” in a quantum internet with a fixed linear‐optical photonic circuit that can reconfigure which user‐pairs share entanglement in a single device, even in coherent superposition of routing choices.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, a single ancilla photon as a control qubit, linear optics and post-selected photon detections—no cavities, no dynamic feed-forward, and state encoding is purely abstract.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a high-level target for Pytheus: a photonic “quantum switch” that routes entanglement on demand between any two of four network ports, programmable by a single-photon control qubit.  

Explanation  
We imagine two Bell‐pair sources S₁ and S₂, each emitting two photons into an integrated linear-optical circuit. A third “address” single photon carries the logical control qubit |ψ⟩_ctrl = α|0⟩+β|1⟩ into a separate input. The circuit performs, in a single fixed interferometer, a *controlled‐entanglement‐swap*:  
  – If the control is found in |0⟩, the device routes S₁’s pair to Ports A–B and S₂’s pair to Ports C–D.  
  – If the control is in |1⟩, it cross-connects: S₁’s photons exit at Ports A–D and S₂’s at Ports B–C.  

By post-selecting on a heralding detector click pattern of the control line, the remaining four photons emerge in the joint state  
  α |0⟩_ctrl⊗(Bell_AB⊗Bell_CD) + β |1⟩_ctrl⊗(Bell_AD⊗Bell_BC).  

This is a coherent, programmable entanglement router—an essential primitive for a photonic quantum internet.

    • Port S₂ (second Bell pair) → circuit  
    • Port Ctrl (single photon) → circuit  
  Linear-optical network

  Outputs (bottom):  
    • Ports 0–3: four “user” ports (A,B,C,D)  
    • Port 4: heralding detector on Ctrl line  

Key Pytheus settings (sketch)  
  • probabilistic pair‐sources: [S₁,S₂]  
  • single_emitter: [Ctrl]  
  • num_anc = 1 (the heralding click on the control detector)  
  • removed_connections to forbid S₁→{C,D} and S₂→{A,B} when ctrl=0, and vice versa for ctrl=1  
  • target_quantum = superposition of the eight basis strings corresponding to Bell_AB⊗Bell_CD and Bell_AD⊗Bell_BC, each tagged by ctrl=0 or 1  

Generalization  
  • N-port entanglement switch: extend to more Bell sources and more control photons.  
  • On‐chip quantum routing fabric: tile many such switches to build a scalable quantum photonic network.  

This proposal is purely in the domain of quantum networking (entanglement swapping and routing) and avoids forbidden state‐generation targets. Pytheus can search the space of linear-optical connections to realize this programmable entanglement router.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed programmable entanglement router is essentially just two simultaneous controlled-SWAP operations—one per Bell pair—conditioned on a single-photon control qubit. That is a straightforward extension of the ensemble’s “Heralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP,” which routes a single data qubit by a control photon. Applying it twice to two Bell pairs does not introduce a new primitive beyond trivial scaling. There is no fundamentally new quantum networking or causal-order effect here, just two parallel controlled swaps.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This target is too close to the ensemble’s Heralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router (linear-optical CSWAP) and merely duplicates that routing primitive on a second Bell pair. Scaling from one data qubit to two entangled qubits does not yield a qualitatively new or nontrivial effect for PRL-worthy novelty—you need a mechanism or network structure that goes beyond parallel CSWAPs to earn acceptance.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “quantum internet” and “quantum photonic circuit”:
    a) A photonic switch (controlled‐CSWAP) routing two entangled pairs on demand—too close to known heralded router.
    b) A parallel entanglement‐repeater node that swaps two links simultaneously—an incremental extension of existing 3pES.
    c) A “butterfly” network‐coding photonic chip that implements the quantum‐internet analogue of the classical butterfly network: two source nodes each hold half of a Bell pair and wish to simultaneously establish Bell links with two distinct destination nodes across a single bottleneck link, all realized by a single integrated linear‐optical circuit and multi-photon interference (no dynamic feed-forward).
  Step 2:  
    a) Already too similar to prior CSWAP/routing experiments.  
    b) Very close in spirit to 3pES’s multi-swap.  
    c) Novel: This uses the concept of quantum network coding—never yet turned into a photonic circuit in Pytheus—and fuses two entanglement‐swaps into one nontrivial 4-photon joint measurement that overcomes a network bottleneck.  
    Obstacles: Must encode a 4-photon joint measurement basis (GHZ-like or network-coding basis) in linear optics; no feedback needed; purely post-selected.  
  Step 3: Pick (c).  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements the *quantum network coding* primitive for entanglement distribution (the “butterfly network”) in a single fixed linear‐optical circuit: one joint measurement both swaps and codes two entanglement links across a bottleneck, going beyond parallel or sequential swaps.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it involves only probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, linear-optical mixing, ancilla photon detectors for heralding a post-selected multi-photon projection, and abstract state targets—no cavities or dynamic feedback.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
Here is a high-level target for Pytheus:

“A photonic network-coding chip implementing the *quantum butterfly network* for entanglement distribution.”

Explanation  
We consider four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S₁…S₄.  
  • S₁ emits photons (A₁,E₁) at network node A and at the central router.  
  • S₂ emits (B₁,E₂) at node B and router.  
  • S₃ emits (C₁,E₃) at router and node C.  
  • S₄ emits (D₁,E₄) at router and D.  

The four “edge” photons {E₁,E₂,E₃,E₄} enter a fixed integrated linear-optical interferometer at the central router and are measured in a suitably chosen 4-photon joint (“network-coding”) basis. Conditioned on a particular click pattern in those four ancilla detectors, the unmeasured photons at A₁, B₁, C₁, D₁ collapse into *two simultaneous Bell pairs*: one between A–C and one between B–D. In other words, the circuit *codes* two entanglement swaps into one nontrivial multi-photon projection, thereby overcoming the bottleneck just as classical network coding does for two competing data streams.

Visualization  
Inputs (top to bottom):  
  – Sources S₁→(A₁,E₁), S₂→(B₁,E₂), S₃→(E₃,C₁), S₄→(E₄,D₁)  
Integrated photonic circuit: beam splitters, phase shifters, waveguide crossings mixing E₁…E₄  
Outputs:  
  – Four “user” ports A₁,B₁,C₁,D₁ (entangled clients)  
  – Four ancilla detectors on E₁…E₄ for post-selection  

Sketch of Pytheus config parameters  
  • probabilistic_pair_sources = [S₁,S₂,S₃,S₄]  
  • num_anc = 4 (detectors on E₁…E₄)  
  • removed_connections to forbid any source from directly sending to unintended user ports (e.g. S₁→C₁,D₁, etc.)  
  • target_quantum = the four basis strings corresponding to the two Bell pairs across (A₁,C₁) and (B₁,D₁):  
       ['0000','0110','1001','1111']  
  • anc_detectors = [anc1,anc2,anc3,anc4]  

Generalizations  
  – Extend to larger network‐coding motifs (e.g. multi-bottleneck, ring structures) on chip  
  – Integrate multiple coding nodes to form a reconfigurable photonic quantum-internet backbone  

This target lies squarely in the domain of quantum networks (entanglement swapping + network coding) and asks Pytheus to discover the optimal linear-optical circuit and measurement basis for a genuinely new entanglement-distribution primitive on a photonic chip. It avoids forbidden state‐generation and uses only Pytheus-supported components.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “quantum butterfly network” target is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution.” Both employ four Bell-pair sources feeding a single four-photon joint interferometric measurement to produce simultaneous Bell pairs A–C and B–D. There is no substantive difference in the primitive or resource savings beyond what has already been proposed.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposed photonic butterfly network-coding chip duplicates the ensemble’s four-photon joint-measurement scheme for two Bell pairs (A–C and B–D) with four ancilla detectors. It lacks new operational features or nontrivial generalizations beyond that existing idea. Please devise a target that departs from this known butterfly entanglement-swapping protocol.

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher first proposed a photonic “quantum switch” routing two Bell pairs via a controlled‐CSWAP circuit. The Supervisor rejected it as essentially identical to an existing “spectral‐control quantum router” from the ensemble. The Researcher then suggested a “quantum butterfly network” that fuses two entanglement swaps into a single 4-photon joint measurement. The Supervisor again rejected it, pointing out that it duplicated the ensemble’s “Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution.” Both suggestions failed novelty screening against the ensemble’s list of prior proposals.

[bullet points]
- The Researcher repeatedly overlooked existing ensemble suggestions when crafting new targets.
- Both proposed ideas were too closely related to already‐listed entanglement‐routing and butterfly network schemes.
- There was no deep novelty gain or network effect beyond trivial scaling of known primitives.
- The dialogue could have been streamlined by pre‐checking the ensemble list to avoid repetition.

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Before sketching new targets, carefully review the ensemble’s list of suggestions and explicitly rule out any that overlap. Aim for protocols that introduce genuinely new network primitives (e.g. indefinite causal order, multi-node graph structures beyond simple swaps) or leverage nonstandard measurement supermaps rather than scaling existing two-swap schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ideas fusing “quantum internet” + “quantum photonic circuit”:
    a) A programmable photonic switch (controlled-CSWAP) routing two Bell pairs on demand.
    b) A butterfly network‐coding module distributing two Bell links over a single bottleneck via 4-photon joint measurement.
    c) A *quantum SWITCH* of two entanglement‐swapping operations: coherently superpose the order in which two adjacent repeater swaps occur along a three‐link chain, using a single ancilla photon.  
  Step 2:  
    a) Too close to existing heralded CSWAP routers.  
    b) Already proposed as a “butterfly” coding chip above.  
    c) Novel—no Pytheus experiment has indefinite causal order of network primitives.  
    Pytheus obstacle check: only uses probabilistic pair sources, one single‐photon emitter, linear optics, number‐resolving detectors, no feed‐forward.  
  Step 3: Choose (c).  
  Step 4: This is novel because it implements the first *indefinite‐causal‐order* entanglement‐swapping primitive on a photonic chip: the two BSMs at repeater nodes B and C happen in coherent superposition of “B then C” and “C then B,” entangling end nodes A and D in a way that cannot be described by any fixed causal sequence.  
  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus since it only requires three probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon control emitter, a fixed linear‐optical network, and post‐selected photon detections—no cavities or feedback control.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Here is a high-level target for Pytheus: 

“A photonic‐chip implementation of *indefinite‐order entanglement swapping* (the quantum SWITCH of two BSMs) across a three‐link repeater chain.”

Explanation  
We label four network nodes in a line: A–B–C–D. Three probabilistic pair sources create Bell pairs S_AB (A–B), S_BC (B–C), S_CD (C–D). A single‐photon “control” emitter prepares |ψ⟩_ctrl=α|0⟩+β|1⟩ in two spatial modes. The integrated linear‐optical circuit routes the two middle photons (from S_BC) through two Bell-state measurement (BSM) modules—one at “virtual node” B and one at C—in a *superposition* of the orders B→C and C→B, conditioned by the control photon’s path. All beam splitters and phase shifters are fixed; the ancilla’s spatial qubit coherently selects which BSM is applied first. Four number‐resolving detectors herald the two BSM outcomes; we post-select on the click pattern that indicates both swaps succeeded. The surviving photons at A and D emerge entangled, *and* are left correlated with the control qubit—demonstrating an entangled SWITCH of two entanglement-swaps.

Visualization  
Inputs (top to bottom):  
  • S_AB → modes A₁,B₁  
  • S_BC → modes B₂,C₂  
  • S_CD → modes C₃,D₃  
  • Control single photon → two spatial modes ctl0, ctl1  

Integrated photonic circuit:  
  • ctl0 directs the B₂/C₂ photon pair through BSM₁ then BSM₂  
  • ctl1 directs them through BSM₂ then BSM₁  
  • Phase shifters ensure coherence of the superposition  
Outputs:  
  • Two ancilla detectors at each BSM module (four total) for heralding  
  • Two “user” ports at A₁ and D₃  

Task for Pytheus  
  • probabilistic_pair_sources = [S_AB,S_BC,S_CD]  
  • single_emitters = [Control]  
  • num_anc = 4 (BSM detectors)  
  • removed_connections to forbid direct S_AB→C₂/D₃ etc., enforcing proper network topology  
  • target_quantum = the three‐qubit state on (ctrl,A,D) which Pytheus will recognize as the post-selected coherent superposition of the two swap‐order outcomes  

Generalizations  
  – Scale to longer chains: superpose multiple swap orders simultaneously  
  – Tile multiple SWITCH nodes into a reconfigurable photonic quantum‐internet fabric  

This target transcends fixed‐order swapping or routing: it asks Pytheus to discover the optimum linear‐optical circuit and measurement scheme for a genuinely new network primitive—*indefinite causal order of entanglement distribution*—on a photonic chip.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to superpose two Bell‐swap orders (B→C then C→B vs. C→B then B→C) to implement an indefinite‐order entanglement swap between A and D is precisely the “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic‐Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders” already in the ensemble list. It offers no new mechanism beyond that primitive and so fails the novelty bar.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This indefinite‐order swap target duplicates the ensemble’s “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic‐Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders” (B→C→D vs. C→B→D). You need to propose a network or causal‐order effect that goes beyond this two‐swap quantum switch to qualify as genuinely novel.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible primitives fusing "quantum internet" + "quantum photonic circuit":
    a) A 2‐pair entanglement router (controlled‐CSWAP) – already too close to known heralded routers.
    b) A butterfly network‐coding chip – already explored.
    c) A 3-way entanglement “switchboard”: on a star network of three user nodes, a single qutrit control photon routes (or post-selects) an entangled Bell link between *any two* of the three users in *one* fixed linear-optical circuit.
  Step 2:
    a) & b) match previous work.
    c) is genuinely new: no Pytheus experiment has implemented a multi-port entanglement switch to dynamically allocate a Bell pair among three nodes.
    Pytheus can handle a single qutrit emitter, three probabilistic pair sources, pure linear optics and photon-number-resolving detectors—no cavities, no feedback.
  Step 3: Choose (c).
  Step 4: This is novel because it extends the concept of an entanglement router from 2→2 ports to a *3→2* switchboard: a single device that, on demand (or by post-selection), entangles *any* pair among three user nodes, controlled by a single photonic qutrit.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it uses only probabilistic pair sources, one 3-level single-photon emitter, passive interferometry, and post-selected detections—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a high-level target for Pytheus:

“A 3-way entanglement switchboard on a photonic chip: use one qutrit control photon to route a Bell pair to any two of three user nodes in a single fixed linear-optical network.”

Explanation  
We have seven input sources (nodes 0…6):

 • Nodes 0–1: pair source S₀ generating one Bell pair → User A & B  
 • Nodes 2–3: pair source S₁ → User A & C  
 • Nodes 4–5: pair source S₂ → User B & C  
 • Node 6: single-photon emitter (control) in a 3-dimensional state α|0⟩+β|1⟩+γ|2⟩  

These seven photons enter a fixed integrated linear-optical circuit of beam splitters and phase shifters. Output detectors 0,1,2 correspond to the three user nodes A,B,C; detector 3 collects the control photon.  

Configuration constraints (removed_connections):

 • For S₀ (inputs 0,1), forbid connections to C (detector 2) and control (detector 3).  
 • For S₁ (inputs 2,3), forbid to B (detector 1) and control (detector 3).  
 • For S₂ (inputs 4,5), forbid to A (detector 0) and control (detector 3).  
 • For the control emitter (input 6), forbid to A,B,C (detectors 0,1,2).  

Heralding: post-select on exactly one click at the control detector (node 3) and one click at each of the two target user detectors (two of {0,1,2}).  

Target quantum states (4-photon strings [ctrl,A,B,C]):

  • ctrl=0 → Bell between A–B (C=0):  
      “0000”  (|0⟩_ctrl|0⟩_A|0⟩_B|0⟩_C)  
      “0110”  (|0⟩_ctrl|1⟩_A|1⟩_B|0⟩_C)  
  • ctrl=1 → Bell A–C (B=0):  
      “1000”  (|1⟩_ctrl|0⟩_A|0⟩_B|0⟩_C)  
      “1011”  (|1⟩_ctrl|1⟩_A|0⟩_B|1⟩_C)  
  • ctrl=2 → Bell B–C (A=0):  
      “2000”  (|2⟩_ctrl|0⟩_A|0⟩_B|0⟩_C)  
      “2011”  (|2⟩_ctrl|0⟩_A|1⟩_B|1⟩_C)

Generalization  
  • Extend to N user nodes with one N-level control qudit → N→2 entanglement routing.  
  • Build a mesh of such switchboards for fully reconfigurable on-chip quantum-internet fabrics.  

This target is purely a quantum-network primitive (entanglement routing among three nodes), uses only Pytheus-compatible elements (probabilistic pairs, single emitters, linear optics, number-resolving detectors), and does *not* generate forbidden states.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “3-way entanglement switchboard” simply generalizes the previously proposed multiplexed entanglement router to three user nodes, selecting among A–B, A–C, or B–C by a higher-dimensional control. The ensemble has already suggested a hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic “Quantum Entanglement Router” that on demand routes Bell pairs among the same three node combinations. Merely increasing the control dimension without a new operational feature or fundamentally different mechanism is not PRL-level novelty.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme duplicates the ensemble’s multiplexed three-node entanglement router (Alice–Bob, Alice–Charlie, Bob–Charlie) under a different implementation (qutrit control). To achieve novelty, you need a genuinely new primitive or nontrivial extension beyond simple multi‐port routing.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ideas that fuse “quantum internet” (entanglement swapping/teleportation across nodes) with “quantum photonic circuit” (fixed linear optics, pair sources, single emitters, no feedback):
    a) A 2→2 photonic entanglement router (controlled CSWAP on two Bell pairs)—too close to known heralded routers.
    b) The quantum butterfly network‐coding chip distributing two Bell links over one bottleneck—already explored.
    c) A dual‐destination *teleportation switch*: use one unknown‐qubit single‐photon input, two Bell‐pair sources, plus a single‐photon control qubit to teleport that unknown qubit to *either* of two receiver nodes in coherent superposition, all in one fixed linear‐optical network and post‐selected heralds.
  Step 2:  
    a) & b) collide with past ideas.  
    c) is novel—no Pytheus experiment yet mixes teleportation *and* programmable routing in superposition.  
    Pytheus feasibility: uses only single emitters, probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, number‐resolving detectors, post‐selection—no dynamic feed‐forward or forbidden cavities.
  Step 3: Select (c).
  Step 4: This is novel because it realizes the first *teleportation‐router* on chip: an unknown input qubit is teleported to one of two destinations under quantum control, outputting a coherent correlation between the control and the teleported location.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we need exactly one input single‐photon emitter (the unknown qubit), two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon control emitter, a fixed interferometer mixing those five photons, and post‐selected heralding on four ancilla detectors—fully within Pytheus’s component set.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a high‐level target for Pytheus:

“A dual‐destination teleportation switch on a photonic chip: teleport an *unknown* qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single‐photon ‘address’ qubit.”

Explanation  
We use five sources:  
 • Input emitter I (mode 0) carrying the unknown qubit |ψ⟩_in  
 • Bell‐pair source S_B (modes 1 & 2) shared between the router and Receiver B  
 • Bell‐pair source S_C (modes 3 & 4) shared between the router and Receiver C  
 • Control emitter C (mode 5) prepared in α|0⟩+β|1⟩ across two spatial paths ctl0/ctl1  

These five photons enter a fixed linear‐optical interferometer of beam‐splitters and phase‐shifters. Inside the circuit we perform *two partial Bell‐state measurements* (BSMs)—one on {I,½S_B} and one on {I,½S_C}—but the control photon coherently routes the input photon to only one BSM first. Heralding detectors on the four BSM output modes post‐select the successful teleportation event. The remaining half of the chosen Bell pair exits at the corresponding receiver port (B or C).

Post‐selection on the four BSM clicks yields the joint output state  
  α |0⟩_ctrl⊗|ψ⟩_B + β |1⟩_ctrl⊗|ψ⟩_C  

—i.e. the unknown qubit has been teleported to B if the address was |0⟩, or to C if |1⟩, in coherent superposition.

Generalizations  
 – Extend to N destinations with one N‐level control qudit and N Bell‐pair sources.  
 – Tile multiple teleportation‐switch modules into a reconfigurable photonic quantum‐internet fabric.  

This proposal lies squarely in quantum networks (teleportation + routing), uses only Pytheus‐compatible elements (single emitters, pair sources, linear optics, number‐resolving detectors, no feedback), and does *not* target forbidden state generation.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed dual‐destination teleportation switch genuinely departs from the existing controlled‐SWAP routing and “direct‐vs‐teleport” superposition experiments by inserting a coherent, control‐gated teleportation step to steer an unknown qubit onto one of two spatially separated Bell links in superposition. No prior proposal in our lists superposes *two* teleportation BSMs to different receivers under single‐photon control. This is a new networking primitive—not merely a scaling of a CSWAP router or an entanglement‐swap quantum switch—and it cannot be reduced to any of the ensemble’s targets. It therefore merits further PRL‐level study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The dual‐destination teleportation switch implements a coherently controlled, single‐interferometer teleportation to two separate receivers, a new primitive beyond direct SWAP routing or fixed teleportation, and so qualifies as a novel quantum‐network target.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip

Mini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon “address” qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal extends the quantum‐communication toolbox by combining teleportation with a programmable destination switch, all in a static linear‐optical network and post‐selection, which lies squarely in PyTheus’s sweet spot of designing heralded, feed‐forward‐free protocols. The use of a single‐photon address qubit to coherently route an unknown input onto one of two Bell‐pair channels is novel yet physically sound under entanglement‐by‐path‐identity and four‐fold heralding. PyTheus can readily optimize the required graph and weight configuration for this multiplexed teleportation switch.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is an innovative and technically well‐grounded application of PyTheus’s graph‐based design capabilities to quantum teleportation and routing. The static, post‐selected network with a single‐photon control qubit offers genuine novelty, and the proposed components and heralding scheme are realistic for current photonic platforms.
