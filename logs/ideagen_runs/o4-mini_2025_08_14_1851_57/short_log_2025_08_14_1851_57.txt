Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to combine “long-range entanglement” and “Lindblad master equation” in a Pytheus-compatible target, avoiding pure state generation and sticking to network/measurement primitives:
  a) Heralded non-demolition parity measurement between two remote photonic qubits (nodes A and C) mediated by a third (node B). The measurement jump operators (L_even, L_odd) appear as Lindblad jumps; the network uses entanglement swapping + ancilla and beam splitters.  
  b) Teleportation chain over N links, each link including an engineered phase-damping channel implemented via a beam splitter + vacuum ancilla + post-selection. The overall channel is the solution of a Lindblad master eq. for dephasing, and the network studies the scaling of entanglement fidelity vs. chain length.  
  c) Dissipative entanglement stabilization: Use measurement and ancilla to implement a jump operator L = |Ψ–⟩⟨00| (or similar) on a two-node system, so that repeated heralded measurement “cools” the pair into a dark Bell subspace across distant nodes.  

Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
  a) Parity check: none of the past experiments target a non-local measurement primitive. Pytheus can do linear optics + ancilla + post-selection. Feasible.  
  b) Teleportation + dephasing: simulating a channel is unusual but Pytheus only handles pure post-selected states. Incorporating vacuum ancilla and partial detection to simulate dephasing may be tricky.  
  c) Dissipative stabilization: would require repeated rounds or feedback; Pytheus cannot do dynamic feedback.  

Step 3: Pick (a) as most novel and feasible. 
Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus targets implement a non-demolition joint measurement (parity check) across spatially separated photonic qubits, nor cast that measurement as engineered jump operators akin to Lindblad dissipators.  
Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancillary photons, linear-optical mixing and projective detection—exactly the tools Pytheus can optimize. It avoids forbidden state-generation targets by focusing on a network transformation: a heralded parity measurement (quantum instrument) rather than preparing a specific output state.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input: 
Description:
We propose to design a heralded, non-demolition parity measurement of two remote photonic qubits (nodes A and C) mediated by an intermediate node B.  This measurement acts as the jump operators L_even and L_odd in a Lindblad master equation for parity stabilization, and can be used as a building block for long-distance quantum error detection, entanglement purification, and repeater protocols.

Structure Visualization:
1. Photon-pair sources:
   • Source S_AB produces an entangled pair between modes A and B1.
   • Source S_BC produces an entangled pair between modes B2 and C.
2. Linear-optical network at node B:
   • Modes B1 and B2 enter an optimized interferometer (beam splitters + phase shifters).
   • Additional single-photon ancilla inputs may be injected.
   • Outputs include two ancillary detectors (“jump detectors”) and two heralding detectors.
3. Heralding:
   • A click pattern in the jump detectors heralds “even parity” (projecting onto |00⟩_AC or |11⟩_AC), implementing jump operator L_even ∝ |00⟩⟨00|+|11⟩⟨11|.
   • A complementary click pattern heralds “odd parity” (|01⟩_AC or |10⟩_AC), jump operator L_odd.
4. Post-measurement:
   • Modes A and C exit unmeasured (non-demolition) carrying the post-parity state.
   • Classical outcome (even/odd) known to the distant parties.

Target Quantum Instrument:
We encode the transformation on the four basis inputs at A,C:
  |00⟩ → even outcome, output |00⟩  
  |11⟩ → even outcome, output |11⟩  
  |01⟩ → odd outcome, output |01⟩  
  |10⟩ → odd outcome, output |10⟩  
and no other coincidences.  The network should be optimized to maximize heralding fidelity and minimize ancilla count.

Why novel:
   • No existing Pytheus experiment realises a non-destructive parity check between distant nodes via entanglement swapping.
   • Casts the measurement as Lindblad jump operators for parity, enabling dissipative stabilization protocols.

Why feasible:
   • Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-counting—fully within Pytheus’s scope.
   • Avoids dynamic feedback or state generation targets; focuses on a quantum instrument (measurement transformation).
   • Generalizes to multi-node parity checks, qutrit or qudit parity, and builds directly towards measurement-based repeaters and error-detecting networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal focuses on implementing a genuinely new quantum instrument—the non-demolition parity check of two remote photonic qubits cast explicitly as the Lindblad jump operators L_even and L_odd—rather than merely generating states. While two-qubit parity measurements and local stabilizer readouts have appeared (e.g. the four-body toric‐code plaquette parity in the ensemble, or the nonlocal XOR gate for key agreement which outputs only a classical bit), none realize a heralded, entanglement-mediated, non‐destructive parity projection that leaves the A C qubits intact for further dissipative stabilization. Framing the measurement as jump operators paves the way to true dissipative parity‐stabilization and repeater building blocks, which has not been addressed in the prior list. Action: accept Action Input: This experiment defines a novel measurement transformation—an on‐demand, heralded, non‐demolition parity instrument between distant photonic qubits—fully within a linear‐optical, feed-forward‐free toolbox. It stands apart from known state‐generation and classical parity primitives and offers a clear path to Lindblad‐engineered stabilization and error‐detecting networks, making it worthy of detailed investigation.
