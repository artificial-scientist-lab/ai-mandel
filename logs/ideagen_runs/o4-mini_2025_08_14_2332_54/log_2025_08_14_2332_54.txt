    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought:\n Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201cRydberg atom array\u201d and \u201ctruncated Wigner\u201d into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network target (no state generation):\n  A) Two-hop post-selected photonic teleportation chain linking three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, with truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise-model optimization.  \n  B) Multipartite entanglement routing: use entanglement swapping to redistribute an input qubit stored in one Rydberg node across an entire small array, using truncated Wigner as a guide to pick the best linear-optical interferometer settings.  \n  C) Loss-resilient repeater link: design a repeat-until-success entanglement-swapping network for Rydberg-ensemble memories, benchmarked via truncated-Wigner\u2013based error estimates, but implemented purely in post-selected linear optics.  \n Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:\n  A) Two-hop teleportation is a natural network\u2010extension beyond single-swap teleportation. Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols."

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders.

By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap\n\nAbstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections.

Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes.

By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders.

This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap\n\nAbstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.  By scaling the control dimension or adding further swap\u2010modules, one can explore richer causal\u2010structure experiments, all within post\u2010selected linear optics and guided by truncated\u2010Wigner noise modeling.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the standard \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d applied to two sequential Bell\u2010swap operations, a protocol already present in the ensemble (\u201cImplementing an Entanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic\u2010Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d). It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition.

By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.  By scaling the control dimension or adding further swap\u2010modules, one can explore richer causal\u2010structure experiments, all within post\u2010selected linear optics and guided by truncated\u2010Wigner noise modeling.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the standard \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d applied to two sequential Bell\u2010swap operations, a protocol already present in the ensemble (\u201cImplementing an Entanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic\u2010Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d). It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

It uses only SPDC sources, linear optics, post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s scope.\n    B) Secret-sharing overlaps with multi-swap examples and edges ambiguous.\n    C) Multipath teleportation resembles the SWITCH idea and may border on dynamic heralding, risking implicit feedback.\n  Step 3: Choose A: post-selected entanglement purification of Rydberg-memory Bell pairs.\n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    This is the first Pytheus target to design a linear-optical network that takes two imperfectly entangled photonic qubit pairs (initially stored in Rydberg\u2010atom memories), performs a Bell-parity measurement in a single post-selected circuit, and outputs one heralded, higher-fidelity Bell pair back into the memories.\n  Step 5: Feasibility:\n    Pytheus can optimize the needed SPDC pair sources (two for the input pairs, plus ancilla photons), beam-splitter network and detector layout, enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections between final memories, and yield the post-selected target_quantum ['00','11']. The truncated Wigner model fixes num_anc and detection thresholds\u2014no dynamic feedback or state generation is required.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer).

By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.  By scaling the control dimension or adding further swap\u2010modules, one can explore richer causal\u2010structure experiments, all within post\u2010selected linear optics and guided by truncated\u2010Wigner noise modeling.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the standard \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d applied to two sequential Bell\u2010swap operations, a protocol already present in the ensemble (\u201cImplementing an Entanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic\u2010Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d). It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.

It uses only SPDC sources, linear optics, post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s scope.\n    B) Secret-sharing overlaps with multi-swap examples and edges ambiguous.\n    C) Multipath teleportation resembles the SWITCH idea and may border on dynamic heralding, risking implicit feedback.\n  Step 3: Choose A: post-selected entanglement purification of Rydberg-memory Bell pairs.\n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    This is the first Pytheus target to design a linear-optical network that takes two imperfectly entangled photonic qubit pairs (initially stored in Rydberg\u2010atom memories), performs a Bell-parity measurement in a single post-selected circuit, and outputs one heralded, higher-fidelity Bell pair back into the memories.\n  Step 5: Feasibility:\n    Pytheus can optimize the needed SPDC pair sources (two for the input pairs, plus ancilla photons), beam-splitter network and detector layout, enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections between final memories, and yield the post-selected target_quantum ['00','11']. The truncated Wigner model fixes num_anc and detection thresholds\u2014no dynamic feedback or state generation is required.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.

    "output": "Thought:\n  We propose a genuinely new network primitive: a coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum channels\u2014direct transmission (identity) and teleportation\u2014between two Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes, controlled by a single photonic qubit.  This \u201cchannel superposition\u201d goes beyond fixed\u2010order swaps or purification modules and realizes a new communication primitive.  It is fully post\u2010selected, uses only SPDC sources, linear optics, and detectors (no feedback), and is guided by a truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model for ancilla counts and click thresholds.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cCoherent Superposition of Direct Transmission and Teleportation Channel for Rydberg Ensembles\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distant Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes, A and B.  Node A holds an arbitrary photonic qubit stored in its spin wave; Node B is the receiver.  A photonic control qubit prepared at A coherently routes the data qubit into one of two paths:\n   1) Direct\u2010delay path: the photon is sent through an optical delay line straight to B (identity channel).  \n   2) Teleportation path: the photon is jointly Bell\u2010measured with one half of an SPDC\u2010generated ancilla pair; the other half of that pair is sent to B, completing teleportation via post\u2010selective Bell clicks.\n  After post\u2010selection on the specific double\u2010click pattern in the Bell analyzer, and detection of the control qubit at the output, the data qubit arrives at B entangled with the control.  The final two\u2010qubit post\u2010selected state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode 0) and the delivered qubit (mode 1).  \n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A truncated\u2010Wigner noise model for photon loss and mode\u2010mismatch determines:\n   \u2022 num_anc: the number of ancilla SPDC photons to include  \n   \u2022 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector\u2010click probability thresholds that maximize fidelity  \n  These parameters feed into the Pytheus config.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters:\n    [0: CTRL single-photon emitter at A]  \n    [1: SPDC source]  \n    [2\u2026N: Ancilla SPDC sources]  \n  Static interferometer:\n    \u2022 A beamsplitter network routing the data photon controlled by the control qubit  \n    \u2022 One arm is a passive delay line (identity path)  \n    \u2022 Other arm feeds into a Bell\u2010analyzer (beam splitters + ancilla detectors) for teleportation  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: data_out at B] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cIdentity-vs-Teleport Superposition\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cChanSuper_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[1,2]]    # forbid any SPDC from linking directly into the identity output  \n  single_emitters: [0]  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This channel-superposition primitive can be generalized to longer delay lines vs. multi-hop teleportation networks, or to superpose any pair of distinct network modules (e.g. purification vs. swap), all within post-selected linear optics and guided by truncated\u2010Wigner noise modeling."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap\n\nAbstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.

This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.

Node A holds an arbitrary photonic qubit stored in its spin wave; Node B is the receiver.  A photonic control qubit prepared at A coherently routes the data qubit into one of two paths:\n   1) Direct\u2010delay path: the photon is sent through an optical delay line straight to B (identity channel).  \n   2) Teleportation path: the photon is jointly Bell\u2010measured with one half of an SPDC\u2010generated ancilla pair; the other half of that pair is sent to B, completing teleportation via post\u2010selective Bell clicks.\n  After post\u2010selection on the specific double\u2010click pattern in the Bell analyzer, and detection of the control qubit at the output, the data qubit arrives at B entangled with the control.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap\n\nAbstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.

It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

To protect against loss or bit\u2010flip errors during teleportation, the protocol proceeds in two stages within one static linear\u2010optical network, guided by a truncated\u2010Wigner noise analysis:\n\n  1) Parallel Bell-Swap Modules:\n     \u2022 Three SPDC pair sources prepare three photonic Bell resources: P\u2081 between A\u2013X\u2081, P\u2082 between A\u2013X\u2082, P\u2083 between A\u2013X\u2083.\n     \u2022 The data photon and one photon from each P\u1d62 enter three separate Bell analyzers at A.  \n     \u2022 Each analyzer is a small interferometer (beam splitters + phase shifters) with its own ancilla detectors.  \n\n  2) Parity-Check Ancilla Network:\n     \u2022 Ancilla photons (number set by truncated-Wigner) interfere across the three analyzer outputs.\n     \u2022 A collective parity-measurement subcircuit flags if an odd number of Bell measurements failed (e.g. due to loss or bit flips).\n     \u2022 We post-select only events with even parity (i.e. zero or two faulty outcomes), thereby rejecting single\u2010error runs.\n\n  Upon successful post-selection (specific pattern of ancilla clicks plus one click in each Bell analyzer), the three remaining partner photons from P\u2081,P\u2082,P\u2083 are routed to B and recombined in a decoding interferometer (another small beam-splitter network) that reconstructs the original qubit and stores it in B\u2019s Rydberg memory.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  \u2013 A truncated-Wigner model of photon\u2010loss and mode-mismatch fixes:\n      \u2022 num_anc \u2014 the number of ancilla photons (and ancilla SPDC sources)  \n      \u2022 bulk_thr, thresholds \u2014 click\u2010probability thresholds for each detector group  \n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not alter the abstract target quantum mapping.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  Emitters:\n    [0: Data qubit emitter at A]  \n    [1,2,3: SPDC P\u2081,P\u2082,P\u2083]  \n    [4\u2026M: Ancilla SPDC sources]\n\n  Static interferometer:\n    \u2022 Three Bell analyzers (Data+P\u1d62)  \n    \u2022 Parity-check mixer for ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Decoding interferometer at B\n\n  Detectors:\n    [0: Output qubit at B] [1: Parity\u2010flag ancilla detectors\u2026] [2,3,4: Bell\u2010analyzer triggers]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cErrorDetect_Teleport\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cED_Teleport_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  # post-selected identity channel for one qubit  \n  removed_connections: [[0,5],[1,6],[2,7]]  # forbid any direct source to B\u2019s output outside the teleportation path  \n  single_emitters: [0]  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  By changing the number of parallel Bell modules or the structure of the parity-check subcircuit, one can generalize to repetition-code teleportation, multi\u2010error detection, or nested detection+teleportation schemes\u2014all designed by Pytheus under realistic truncated-Wigner\u2013informed noise constraints.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The protocol duplicates known repetition-code teleportation and parity-check error detection. To be novel, propose a genuinely new primitive\u2014e.g. a higher-order causal structure or topologically protected error-flagging mechanism\u2014rather than a standard code-based post-selection.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!! STATE GENERATION IS FORBIDDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS\nALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. \u2013 PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM.

Node A holds an unknown qubit in its collective spin-wave memory and releases it as a photonic qubit.  The network uses three SPDC sources and ancilla photons to implement the optimum 1\u21922 universal telecloning transformation in a single post-selected linear-optical circuit.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored.

    "output": "Thought:\n  We propose a genuinely new network primitive\u2014a post\u2010selected, error\u2010mitigated teleportation channel achieved by placing two noisy teleportation modules in an indefinite causal order (a \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d) between three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes.  Individually each Bell\u2010swap module\u2014with loss and mode\u2010mismatch characterized by a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model\u2014yields below\u2010threshold teleportation fidelity.  But by coherently superposing the two modules\u2019 orders under a single control qubit and post\u2010selecting on specific detector patterns, correlated errors cancel and one realizes a high\u2010fidelity teleportation channel.  This goes beyond fixed\u2010order entanglement swapping or purification, combines Rydberg\u2010array memories with truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013guided resource allocation, and remains fully within Pytheus\u2019s post\u2010selected linear\u2010optics framework (no active feed\u2010forward or forbidden state generation).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cError\u2010Mitigated Teleportation via Indefinite Causal Order in a Rydberg Ensemble Network\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We connect three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes A (sender), B (intermediate), and C (receiver).  Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.  The final photonic qubit arrives at C and is stored back in the Rydberg ensemble, entangled with the control.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.

This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension.

Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.  The final photonic qubit arrives at C and is stored back in the Rydberg ensemble, entangled with the control.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored.

Individually each Bell\u2010swap module\u2014with loss and mode\u2010mismatch characterized by a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model\u2014yields below\u2010threshold teleportation fidelity.  But by coherently superposing the two modules\u2019 orders under a single control qubit and post\u2010selecting on specific detector patterns, correlated errors cancel and one realizes a high\u2010fidelity teleportation channel.  This goes beyond fixed\u2010order entanglement swapping or purification, combines Rydberg\u2010array memories with truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013guided resource allocation, and remains fully within Pytheus\u2019s post\u2010selected linear\u2010optics framework (no active feed\u2010forward or forbidden state generation).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cError\u2010Mitigated Teleportation via Indefinite Causal Order in a Rydberg Ensemble Network\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We connect three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes A (sender), B (intermediate), and C (receiver).  Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.  The final photonic qubit arrives at C and is stored back in the Rydberg ensemble, entangled with the control.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

Pytheus can optimize it: abstract state description, removed_connections to forbid unwanted links, number_resolving detectors. Truncated\u2010Wigner model fixes num_anc and thresholds. No dynamic feedback.\n    B) \u201cFan\u2010out\u201d conflicts with no\u2010cloning theorem\u2014only trivial duplication of vacuum or classical info\u2014would violate quantum laws if perfect.\n    C) Super\u2010superpositions rehash previous \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d ideas.\n  Step 3: Choose A: post\u2010selected 1\u21922 universal telecloning network.\n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    This is the first proposal of a linear\u2010optical, post\u2010selected telecloning network that takes a photonic qubit retrieved from a Rydberg\u2010ensemble memory and produces two optimal\u2010fidelity clones in remote Rydberg nodes, all in a single static SPDC+interferometer layout. Prior Pytheus designs only cover exact entanglement swap or single\u2010qubit teleportation, not approximate multi\u2010output cloning.\n  Step 5: Feasibility:\n    \u2022 Pytheus can optimize SPDC pair sources (one for teleportation\u2010like resource + extra ancilla pairs), beam splitter network, and detector placements to approximate the 1\u21922 universal telecloning isometry (an abstract three\u2010photon output state).  \n    \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d forbids any SPDC source from linking directly to both output memories (ensures genuine telecloning).  \n    \u2022 Truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise modeling yields num_anc (ancilla photons) and bulk_thr/thresholds (detection criteria) to maximize average cloning fidelity under loss and mode\u2010mismatch.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed\u2010forward\u2014purely post\u2010selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cPost\u2010Selected 1\u21922 Universal Telecloning of a Rydberg\u2010Emitted Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes: one sender A and two receivers B and C.  Node A holds an unknown qubit in its collective spin-wave memory and releases it as a photonic qubit.  The network uses three SPDC sources and ancilla photons to implement the optimum 1\u21922 universal telecloning transformation in a single post-selected linear-optical circuit.

Individually each Bell\u2010swap module\u2014with loss and mode\u2010mismatch characterized by a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model\u2014yields below\u2010threshold teleportation fidelity.  But by coherently superposing the two modules\u2019 orders under a single control qubit and post\u2010selecting on specific detector patterns, correlated errors cancel and one realizes a high\u2010fidelity teleportation channel.  This goes beyond fixed\u2010order entanglement swapping or purification, combines Rydberg\u2010array memories with truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013guided resource allocation, and remains fully within Pytheus\u2019s post\u2010selected linear\u2010optics framework (no active feed\u2010forward or forbidden state generation).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cError\u2010Mitigated Teleportation via Indefinite Causal Order in a Rydberg Ensemble Network\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We connect three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes A (sender), B (intermediate), and C (receiver).  Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.  The final photonic qubit arrives at C and is stored back in the Rydberg ensemble, entangled with the control.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.

It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.

The key is to propose a higher-order indefinite-order superposition of three entanglement-swapping modules (\u201c3-switch\u201d) controlled by a qutrit, teleporting a qubit across a four-node Rydberg chain, with error-model parameters set by a truncated-Wigner analysis. This goes beyond existing Pytheus designs, remains purely post-selected linear optics, uses only SPDC sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, number-resolving detectors, and one single-photon emitter for the control, and yields an abstract control-qubit map. It scales to N-module superpositions, forming a new family of causal-structure network primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Three-Module Indefinite-Order Entanglement-Swap (\u20183-Switch\u2019) for Teleportation Across a Rydberg Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider four Rydberg\u2010ensemble memory nodes in a line: A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D. A data qubit stored at A is to be teleported to D. Instead of a fixed chain of three sequential Bell swaps, we place the three entanglement\u2010swapping modules between adjacent nodes (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D) in a coherent superposition of three distinct orders, controlled by a single photonic qutrit prepared at A. Specifically:\n    \u2022 Control state |0\u27e9_ctrl \u2192 swap order: (A\u2013B)\u2192(B\u2013C)\u2192(C\u2013D)  \n    \u2022 Control state |1\u27e9_ctrl \u2192 swap order: (B\u2013C)\u2192(C\u2013D)\u2192(A\u2013B)  \n    \u2022 Control state |2\u27e9_ctrl \u2192 swap order: (C\u2013D)\u2192(A\u2013B)\u2192(B\u2013C)  \n  The data photon from A and the three SPDC entangled\u2010pair sources feed into a static beam\u2010splitter/phase\u2010shifter network implementing the control qutrit\u2019s routing and the three Bell analyzers. Ancilla photons (num_anc set by truncated\u2010Wigner) and number\u2010resolving detectors post-select on successful Bell clicks in each module, yielding a heralded teleportation of the data qubit to node D. The final joint state of (control qutrit, teleported qubit) is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9+\u222322\u27e9 (unnormalized), corresponding to the control index and teleported logical outcome, heralded by a specific ancilla\u2010detector signature.\n\nTruncated\u2010Wigner Guidance:\n  We model loss and mode\u2010mismatch via a truncated\u2010Wigner sampling of realistic noise, determining:\n    \u2022 num_anc \u2014 number of ancilla SPDC photons per Bell module  \n    \u2022 bulk_thr and thresholds \u2014 click\u2010probability thresholds to maximize conditional fidelity under noise  \n  These values are fixed in the Pytheus config but do not alter the abstract target.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters:\n    [0: CTRL single-photon emitter at A]  \n    [1: SPDC_AB] [2: SPDC_BC] [3: SPDC_CD]  \n    [4\u2026N: Ancilla SPDC sources]  \n  Static interferometer:\n    \u2022 Mach-Zehnder-like mesh routing the data photon according to the control qutrit state  \n    \u2022 Three Bell analyzers (beam splitters + ancilla detectors), each tied to one swap module  \n    \u2022 Recombination of control arms and joint detection  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: data_out at D] [2\u2026M: ancilla_detectors]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201c3Switch_Teleport_Rydberg\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201c3Switch_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 60  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 30  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11','22']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4]]    # forbid any SPDC sending data directly A\u2192D  \n  single_emitters: [0]  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a new family:\n  \u2013 It realizes a three-module indefinite-order network (\u201c3-switch\u201d), going beyond the two-swap SWITCH.  \n  \u2013 By generalizing to N modules and higher-dimensional control, one can explore rich causal-structure primitives and error-mitigation schemes.  \n  \u2013 The truncated-Wigner model ties resource counts and detection criteria to realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely post-selected linear optics\u2014ideal for Pytheus to design.\n\nThis target defines a new quantum-network primitive: multi-module indefinite causal order for teleportation, merging Rydberg-ensemble memories with truncated-Wigner\u2013guided design, fully within Pytheus\u2019s scope.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This duplicates the existing three-module indefinite\u2010order swap proposal. To be novel, you need a genuinely new network primitive or heralding mechanism\u2014beyond just relabeling swap paths or teleportation targets\u2014such as coupling to nontrivial topological degrees of freedom, using non-Gaussian ancillas, or introducing a fresh causal-structure feature not covered by the current 3-switch concept.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward.

By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.

It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored.

Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap\n\nAbstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.

This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.

A data qubit stored at A is to be teleported to D. Instead of a fixed chain of three sequential Bell swaps, we place the three entanglement\u2010swapping modules between adjacent nodes (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D) in a coherent superposition of three distinct orders, controlled by a single photonic qutrit prepared at A.

Ancilla photons (num_anc set by truncated\u2010Wigner) and number\u2010resolving detectors post-select on successful Bell clicks in each module, yielding a heralded teleportation of the data qubit to node D.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer).

By mixing the dealer\u2019s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer\u2019s secret, while individual players gain no information.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.

It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs.

A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.  The final photonic qubit arrives at C and is stored back in the Rydberg ensemble, entangled with the control.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"rydberg atom array\" and \"truncated wigner\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.

Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored.

A photonic control qubit prepared at A coherently routes the data qubit into one of two paths:\n   1) Direct\u2010delay path: the photon is sent through an optical delay line straight to B (identity channel).  \n   2) Teleportation path: the photon is jointly Bell\u2010measured with one half of an SPDC\u2010generated ancilla pair; the other half of that pair is sent to B, completing teleportation via post\u2010selective Bell clicks.\n  After post\u2010selection on the specific double\u2010click pattern in the Bell analyzer, and detection of the control qubit at the output, the data qubit arrives at B entangled with the control.

Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3.

Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements.

This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters.

The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.  This scheme is directly generalizable to N-hop chains.\n\nNetwork structure (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  \u2022 Node A prepares an atomic spin\u2010wave qubit in a Rydberg ensemble, then emits it as a photonic qubit.  \n  \u2022 An SPDC source at A\u2013B produces an entangled photon pair; one photon goes to A\u2019s Bell-analyzer, the other to node B.  \n  \u2022 At A\u2019s Bell-analyzer (linear-optics interferometer + 2 detectors), a post-selected Bell measurement entangles the input qubit with one arm of the pair, projecting the remaining photon onto node B.  \n  \u2022 At node B, a second SPDC source creates an entangled pair shared between B\u2019s Bell-analyzer and node C.  In B\u2019s analyzer, the received photon from the first swap and one photon of the new pair are jointly measured in a second Bell analyzer.  \n  \u2022 Conditional on two specific detector clicks (one at A, one at B), the final photon delivered to node C now carries the original qubit.  It is stored in the Rydberg ensemble at C.  \n\nKey Pytheus parameters:\n  \u2022 probabilistic SPDC sources as in_nodes  \n  \u2022 two Bell analyzers as sub-networks to optimize (each uses beam splitters & ancilla detectors)  \n  \u2022 removed_connections to forbid any SPDC source from sending photons directly between A\u2194C  \n  \u2022 num_anc set by total required ancilla photons in the analyzers  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract identity map \u22230\u27e9\u2192\u22230\u27e9, \u22231\u27e9\u2192\u22231\u27e9 from input mode at A to output mode at C, post-selected on the two Bell clicks  \n  \u2022 thresholds informed by truncated-Wigner\u2013based loss estimates  \n\nWhy this is interesting:\n  \u2013 It extends single-swap teleportation to a two-hop chain in one holistic linear-optics design.  \n  \u2013 Demonstrates scalable modular teleportation networks, with direct application to distributed Rydberg-ensemble quantum processors.  \n  \u2013 The truncated Wigner framework provides a systematic recipe for setting ancilla counts and detector thresholds under realistic noise, yet the experiment remains purely linear optics and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n\nThis target is a blueprint for a family of N-hop teleportation networks and will both challenge and showcase Pytheus\u2019s power in designing complex multi-stage quantum-network protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal merely strings together two standard post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Bell swaps to realize a two\u2010hop teleportation chain between Rydberg ensembles. This is conceptually just a cascade of entanglement\u2010swapping steps\u2014textbook quantum repeater functionality\u2014and closely parallels countless sequential\u2010swap suggestions in our ensemble (e.g. temporal\u2010mode multiplexing, Creutz\u2010ladder swaps, multi\u2010hop chains). No genuinely new resource, nontrivial superposition, or error\u2010resilience mechanism is introduced beyond the routine \u201cN\u2010hop\u201d extension. It lacks the kind of higher\u2010order network primitive or topological/indefinite\u2010order novelty required for a PRL\u2010worthy target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The two\u2010hop cascade is essentially standard entanglement swapping and too trivial an N\u2010hop extension. Please propose a truly new network primitive\u2014e.g. a coherent superposition of swap orders, measurement\u2010based protection, or an unconventional heralding mechanism\u2014that goes beyond simple sequential Bell swaps.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Entanglement\u2010Swapping Modules Controlled by a Photonic Qubit\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A,B,C,D). A photonic control qubit prepared at node A coherently routes the order of two Bell\u2010swap operations that teleport an arbitrary qubit from A to D:\n   \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013B then B\u2013D  \n   \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: swap A\u2013C then C\u2013D  \n  After post\u2010selected Bell measurements at nodes B and C, the final photonic qubit delivered to node D is entangled with the control.  The resulting two\u2010qubit output state is \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (unnormalized) between control (mode\u20090) and teleported qubit (mode\u20091), heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.  A truncated\u2010Wigner\u2013inspired noise model sets the ancilla\u2010photon counts (num_anc) and detection thresholds (bulk_thr, thresholds) to maximize fidelity in a realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch regime.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources & single control emitter):\n    [CTRL] [SPDC_AB] [SPDC_AC] [SPDC_BD] [SPDC_CD]\n  Linear\u2010optical \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d interferometer:\n    \u2022 A cascaded network of beam splitters and phase shifters that coherently directs the control qubit into one of two Bell\u2010analyzer submodules  \n    \u2022 Two Bell analyzers (one for A\u2013B vs A\u2013C, second for B\u2013D vs C\u2013D), each using ancilla detectors  \n  Detectors:\n    [0: control_out] [1: teleported_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]  \n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cQuantum SWITCH controlled teleportation A\u2192D\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cSWITCH_Teleport\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: 0.02  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <set by truncated\u2010Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 20  \n  target_quantum: ['00','11']  \n  removed_connections: [[0,4],[1,5]]  # forbid any SPDC linking A\u2194D directly  \n  single_emitters: [0]  # control source  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: [0.3,0.15]  \n\nWhy it\u2019s a family:\n  This layout directly generalizes to N\u2010node chains and more complex indefinite\u2010order networks.  By scaling the control dimension or adding further swap\u2010modules, one can explore richer causal\u2010structure experiments, all within post\u2010selected linear optics and guided by truncated\u2010Wigner noise modeling.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the standard \u201cquantum SWITCH\u201d applied to two sequential Bell\u2010swap operations, a protocol already present in the ensemble (\u201cImplementing an Entanglement\u2010Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic\u2010Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d). It adds Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise model, but the core indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swapping primitive is identical. There is no new resource or higher\u2010order network effect beyond that known switch.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This proposal duplicates the previously suggested entanglement\u2010switch quantum switch. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial enhancement\u2014not just relabel the nodes or add a noise model on the same quantum\u2010switch idea.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cPost-Selected Entanglement Purification of Rydberg-Memory Bell Pairs\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We consider two Rydberg-ensemble nodes, A and B, each holding one \u201cnoisy\u201d Bell pair split between two memory qubits: (A1\u2013B1) and (A2\u2013B2).  Each qubit is converted to a photonic mode.  At a central linear-optics station, these four photons enter an optimized interferometer along with ancilla photons.  A post-selected Bell-parity measurement is performed: conditional on a specific pattern of ancilla-detector clicks, one pair (A_out\u2013B_out) is heralded to be in a higher-fidelity Bell state.  The purified photon pair is then re-stored in the Rydberg ensembles.\n\nTruncated-Wigner guidance:\n  A realistic truncated-Wigner noise model for loss and mode mismatch determines:\n   \u2013 num_anc: the number of ancilla photons required to suppress errors,\n   \u2013 bulk_thr and thresholds: detector-click probability thresholds that maximize purification fidelity.\n  These parameters enter the Pytheus config but do not themselves appear in the quantum state description.\n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n  Emitters (SPDC pair sources): [P1] [P2] [Ancilla sources\u2026]  \n    P1 emits A1 & B1  \n    P2 emits A2 & B2  \n    Ancilla sources supply additional photons  \n  Linear-optical purification circuit:\n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix A1,A2 and ancilla modes for a parity check  \n    \u2022 Beam splitters & phase shifters mix B1,B2 and ancilla modes  \n    \u2022 Number-resolving detectors measure ancilla outputs  \n  Output detectors:\n    [0: A_out] [1: B_out] [ancilla_detectors\u2026]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n  description: \u201cRydberg Purification\u201d  \n  foldername: \u201cPurify_Rydberg\u201d  \n  bulk_thr: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  edges_tried: 40  \n  ftol: 1e-06  \n  loss_func: \u201ccr\u201d  \n  num_anc: <from truncated-Wigner>  \n  num_pre: 1  \n  optimizer: \u201cL-BFGS-B\u201d  \n  samples: 15  \n  target_quantum: [\u201800\u2019,\u201911\u2019]  \n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]  # forbid any source linking final outputs directly  \n  single_emitters: []  \n  number_resolving: True  \n  thresholds: <from truncated-Wigner>\n\nWhy this is a family:\n  By varying the number of input pairs or ancilla counts, one can generalize to n-round purification chains, nested purification + teleportation schemes, or multiplexed memory networks, each fully designed by Pytheus under realistic noise guidance.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This proposal is essentially the textbook two\u2010pair parity\u2010check purification implemented in linear optics, with the only twist being Rydberg\u2010ensemble labels and a truncated\u2010Wigner noise\u2010optimization. It does not introduce a new network primitive or nontrivial heralding mechanism beyond standard entanglement purification.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Entanglement purification via a single post-selected parity check is already well explored. To be novel, you need to go beyond the basic two-pair parity filter\u2014for example by coherently superposing different purification orders, embedding a topologically protected parity check, introducing an indefinite-order purification switch, or otherwise creating a genuinely new higher-order network primitive rather than a straightforward N-round extension.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cReconfigurable Entanglement\u2010Routing Switchboard for a Rydberg Atom Array\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We envision a four\u2010node Rydberg\u2010ensemble network (nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D) connected by three SPDC sources: P_AB between A\u21c4B, P_BC between B\u21c4C, and P_CD between C\u21c4D.  At a central linear\u2010optical station, all six signal/idler photons from P_AB, P_BC, P_CD plus additional ancilla photons enter a single, fixed interferometer.  Depending on which subset of ancilla detectors fire, the device heralds one of three possible entanglement\u2010distribution operations:\n   1) A\u2013C entanglement swap (Bell pair between A,C)  \n   2) B\u2013D entanglement swap (Bell pair between B,D)  \n   3) Two-step entanglement swap for a long\u2010distance A\u2013D Bell pair  \n  Each operation is post\u2010selected on a distinct click signature.

Each pair of adjacent nodes is linked by a noisy photonic teleportation module (Bell measurement + SPDC ancilla).  A single photonic control qubit at A routes the data\u2010qubit photon into a coherent superposition of two teleportation\u2010orders:  \n    \u2013 Order |0\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C  \n    \u2013 Order |1\u27e9_ctrl: Teleport A\u2192B then B\u2192C in the reverse causal\u2010combination (modules act in the opposite order on the same noise processes)  \n  Critically, both modules share correlated loss/mode\u2010mismatch noise drawn from the same truncated\u2010Wigner distribution.  Under this indefinite\u2010order superposition, certain noise terms cancel upon post\u2010selection.  We herald success by specific two\u2010Bell\u2010click patterns plus a control\u2010qubit detection.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Pure and indistinguishable single-photon source at telecommunication\n  wavelength\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal quantum key distribution networks: capacitance versus security\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Optimal quantum teleportation of collaboration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Not on the \u201cexplored list.\u201d Pytheus can produce post-selected multi-Bell-measurement networks and abstractly enforce \u201cno direct source\u201d connections. Feasible.  \n  B) Multipartite routing is akin to GHZ\u2010generation via swap; but GHZ\u2010state generation is forbidden. Also \u201crouting\u201d is vague for Pytheus.  \n  C) A repeater\u2010link protocol touches error correction/repeat-until-success (feedback)\u2014Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  \n Step 3: The two-hop teleportation chain (A) is the most concrete, novel, and Pytheus-compatible.  \n Step 4: Novelty:\n  This is the first proposal for a two-segment, post-selected teleportation of an arbitrary qubit across three Rydberg-ensemble nodes, designed end-to-end by a single linear-optics optimization. Prior work covers single-swap entanglement and teleportation only.  \n Step 5: Feasibility:\n  Pytheus can optimize the two Bell\u2010measurement modules (linear-optical interferometers with SPDC ancilla and photon detectors), enforce \u201cno direct pair\u2010source\u201d between non-adjacent nodes, and output an experimental layout. No dynamic feed-forward is needed (we use post\u2010selection).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \u201cTwo-Hop Post-Selected Photonic Teleportation Between Rydberg-Ensemble Nodes\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nWe propose a three-node quantum network that teleports an arbitrary qubit stored in a Rydberg-atom ensemble at node A to a second ensemble at node C via an intermediate Rydberg ensemble at node B, using two sequential, post-selected linear-optical Bell measurements.  The theoretical analysis of loss and mode-mismatch is guided by a truncated-Wigner\u2013inspired noise model, which informs the choice of ancilla resources and threshold criteria.

A data qubit stored at A is to be teleported to D. Instead of a fixed chain of three sequential Bell swaps, we place the three entanglement\u2010swapping modules between adjacent nodes (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D) in a coherent superposition of three distinct orders, controlled by a single photonic qutrit prepared at A.

Ancilla photons (num_anc set by truncated\u2010Wigner) and number\u2010resolving detectors post-select on successful Bell clicks in each module, yielding a heralded teleportation of the data qubit to node D.

A compelling idea is to coherently superpose two distinct noncommuting two\u2010qubit gates (e.g. SWAP vs CNOT) acting on photonic qubits emitted by two Rydberg nodes, controlled by a third Rydberg\u2010emitted control qubit.  This \u201cgate\u2010order switch\u201d goes beyond permuting identical modules (P\u2218S vs S\u2218P) and implements a new primitive: a superposition of two different network operations.  A truncated\u2010Wigner noise model fixes ancilla counts and detector thresholds for realistic loss/mode\u2010mismatch, yet the entire protocol remains a static SPDC + beam-splitter + detector experiment\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s scope.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  \u201cQuantum SWITCH of Two Noncommuting Remote Gates (SWAP vs CNOT) Between Rydberg\u2010Ensemble Memories\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We employ three Rydberg\u2010ensemble nodes:\n    \u2022 Node A emits a single\u2010photon control qubit in state \u03b1|0\u27e9+\u03b2|1\u27e9  \n    \u2022 Nodes B and C each hold and emit one photonic data qubit |\u03c8\u27e9_B,C from their spin\u2010wave memories  \n\n  We wish to apply, in coherent superposition, either:\n    \u2013 Gate G\u2080 = SWAP_{B,C}  (if control=|0\u27e9)  \n    \u2013 Gate G\u2081 = CNOT_{B\u2192C} (if control=|1\u27e9)  \n\n  after which the two output data qubits are re-stored in B and C.  \n  The effective three-qubit output (control\u2297data_B\u2297data_C) is the superposition\n    \u03b1\u2009|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2009G\u2080|\u03c8\u27e9_BC  +  \u03b2\u2009|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2009G\u2081|\u03c8\u27e9_BC\n  heralded by specific ancilla\u2010detector clicks.\n\n  Protocol steps (photons flow top\u2192bottom at a central LO station):\n    1) Emit control qubit from A (single\u2010photon emitter).  \n    2) Emit data qubits from B,C (single\u2010photon emitters).  \n    3) Generate ancilla entangled pairs via SPDC sources:\n         [P_swap] for SWAP module  \n         [P_cnot] for CNOT module  \n         + additional SPDC ancillas (num_anc set by truncated\u2010Wigner)  \n    4) Static interferometer:\n         \u2022 Mach\u2013Zehnder\u2013style routing of data qubits into two subcircuits controlled by the photonic control  \n         \u2022 Subcircuit \u201c0\u201d implements a post-selected SWAP gate (beam splitters + ancilla detectors)  \n         \u2022 Subcircuit \u201c1\u201d implements a post-selected CNOT gate  \n         \u2022 Outputs recombine and feed number\u2010resolving detectors  \n    5) Post-selection:\n         Specific multi-click patterns in the ancilla detectors herald a successful run, projecting out exactly the superposition \u03b1\u2009|0\u27e9G\u2080+\u03b2\u2009|1\u27e9G\u2081.\n\n  Truncated-Wigner-Guided Parameters:\n    We model loss and mode-mismatch by sampling a truncated-Wigner distribution.
