Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully weave “quantum phase estimation” (QPE) together with a “superconducting quantum computer” in a purely photonic‐network language that Pytheus can digest, without ever prescribing state generation or invoking cavities/resonances:

  A) A nonlocal Controlled-Phase gate (CZ or C-Rᶻ(θ)) between two photonic qubits, engineered by entanglement swapping of Bell pairs.  That nonlocal gate is exactly the building block of QPE’s controlled-Uᵏ operations, so one can chain several of these networks (with different θ=2π/2ᵏ) to realize the QPE subroutine in a modular optical network.

  B) A teleportation-based distributed phase sensor: each “superconducting qubit” is abstracted as a local unknown phase φᵢ encoded onto a travelling photonic qubit; these modes are teleported via a central entanglement-swapping hub into a GHZ-like interferometer so that a multi-node QPE (measuring φ₁+φ₂+⋯) is performed in a single‐shot entangled measurement.

  C) A measurement-based QPE: prepare a linear optical cluster-state via probabilistic pair sources and single photons, then perform local measurements that enact the sequence of controlled-Rᶻ(2π/2ᵏ) gates and an inverse quantum Fourier transform on photonic qubits; the superconducting computer is only invoked as the classical phase‐oracle that chooses measurement angles.

Step 2: Quick novelty check and Pytheus-compatibility:

  A) No prior experiment in the list generates a nonlocal CZ by swapping. Pytheus can optimize a small network of pair sources and beam splitters to post-select the CZ truth table. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  
  B) Very interesting but more complex: teleports unknown phases (abstract states) then GHZ interferometry—would amount to state generation of a GHZ-phase state, veering toward forbidden state generation.  
  C) Measurement-based cluster QPE is conceptually heavy: Pytheus does not handle active adaptive measurements or large clusters easily; plus it leans on MBQC, which is close to state generation.

Step 3: Select A as the most promising:  
  • It’s novel—entanglement swapping used not to create entanglement but to enact a two-qubit controlled-phase unitary.  
  • It is a crisp “quantum network” primitive of broad use (every QPE routine needs controlled-U gates).  
  • Pytheus can search for a linear-optical arrangement of two Bell‐pair sources + ancillary detectors + beam splitters/phase shifters to implement post-selected CZ.  
  • It requires no cavities, no feedback; it generalizes immediately to controlled-Rᶻ(2π/2ᵏ) by shifting the phase‐shifter settings. One can chain these modules into a full QPE network later.

Step 4: This idea is novel because we have not seen any entanglement-swapping experiment that produces a nonlocal controlled-phase gate.  All prior examples either generate entangled states or perform teleportation/swap for state generation; none realize a gate as the primary outcome.

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:  
  – It uses only abstract qubits, probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, and post‐selection.  
  – It avoids state‐generation targets.  
  – It defines a network (quantum transformation) that Pytheus can optimize.  
  – It can be generalized to a family of controlled-phase gates with adjustable θ, forming the core of a QPE network.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a post-selected linear-optical network implementing a nonlocal Controlled-Z gate between two photonic qubits (modes 0 and 1), using two independent Bell‐pair sources and entanglement swapping.  No single pair source may emit to both mode-0 and mode-1 (enforced by removed_connections). Two ancillary photons are measured by Charlie to enact the gate.  Conditioned on a particular two-fold click at the ancilla detectors, the transformation on modes 0&1 is
    |00>→|00>,  |01>→|01>,  |10>→|10>,  |11>→−|11>.
Once you have this module, you can shift one internal phase shifter from π to 2π/2ᵏ and thereby build controlled-Rᶻ(2π/2ᵏ) gates.  Chaining these modules and adding a small Fourier-transform network on an ancilla register implements the 2-bit quantum phase estimation algorithm—abstracted entirely in linear optics.

This network is the core building block for distributed quantum phase estimation with superconducting‐verbatim phase oracles: simply reinterpret the abstract θ as coming from a remote superconducting qubit’s phase, and chain multiple modules to realize the full QPE circuit.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal essentially repackages the well‐known teleportation‐based CZ gate (Gottesman–Chuang / KLM style) via entanglement swapping and post‐selection, and then simply chains identical modules to perform a 2-bit phase estimation. Both the nonlocal CZ via two Bell pairs with ancilla measurements and the idea of composing controlled-Rᶻ rotations for QPE have been discussed extensively in the LOQC literature (and echo the “Heralded CPHASE-Gate” sensor and standard photonic QPE demonstrations). There is no genuinely new operational primitive or network effect beyond trivial module concatenation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is just the standard teleportation‐based CZ gate realized with two Bell pairs and ancilla clicks, and chaining it to perform QPE is a straightforward composition. Neither the gate construction nor the phase‐estimation application offers sufficient novelty over existing KLM/Gottesman–Chuang schemes or prior photonic QPE experiments. Please propose a network or measurement effect that goes beyond simple teleportation‐gate modules.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” in a purely photonic network Pytheus can optimize:
  A) Build a post-selected three-qubit controlled-phase gate (CCRθ) by entanglement-swapping three EPR pairs and three ancilla detectors.  This diagonal unitary (1 on all basis states except e^{iθ} on |111>) is the core multi-qubit phase oracle used in QPE circuits; the superconducting processor simply programs θ into a phase shifter.  
  B) Teleport three unknown superconducting-encoded phases φ₁,φ₂,φ₃ onto three photonic qubits, perform a photonic Fourier interferometer that sums φ₁+φ₂+φ₃ using entanglement swapping, and read out the sum via a multi-photon click pattern.  
  C) Prepare a small linear-optical cluster (via probabilistic pair sources), then perform one-shot nonadaptive measurements that enact the entire 2-bit QFT plus controlled-Rᶻ(2π/2ᵏ) gates, where superconducting qubits set the measurement angles.

Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus-fit:
  A) No prior Pytheus target builds a CCZ or C3-Rᶻ gate by swapping three pairs. It’s a pure-network transformation (not state generation), uses only linear optics + post-selection, and generalizes immediately to arbitrary θ → phase estimation oracles.  
  B) Teleporting unknown φᵢ is state-encoding and then generates a new state (sum-phase GHZ), so it borders on forbidden state generation.  
  C) Measurement-based QPE requires adaptive feed-forward on photonic clusters, not possible in Pytheus.

Step 3: Pick A.

Step 4: This idea is novel because no example so far implements a genuine multi-qubit controlled-phase gate (CCRθ) via entanglement-swapping alone. It elevates entanglement swapping from state creation to arbitrary n-qubit phase-oracle modules.

Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it only calls for  
  • Three independent probabilistic EPR sources,  
  • A small interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters (one of them set to θ/3 on each ancilla arm),  
  • Three ancilla detectors for heralding,  
  • No cavities, no active feed-forward, only linear optics, single-photon counting.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for the next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
Design a post-selected three-qubit controlled-phase gate C3-Rᶻ(θ), acting on photonic qubits A,B,C as
   U|xyz⟩ = e^{iθ·xyz}|xyz⟩,
i.e. only |111⟩ picks up e^{iθ}.  This multi-qubit phase oracle is the building block of any quantum phase estimation circuit.  The unknown θ is programmed by a single variable phase shifter inside the ancilla interferometer—this is where you would hook up a superconducting qubit’s phase output.  Upon a successful three-fold click at the ancilla detectors, the effective transformation on modes 0,1,2 is U.

By chaining this module for θ=2π/2ᵏ with a small Fourier network on additional ancilla qubits, you immediately obtain a fully optical 2- or 3-bit quantum phase estimation subcircuit.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal is nothing more than the straightforward generalization of the well‐known two‐qubit teleportation-based CZ gate to three qubits by adding one more Bell pair and ancilla detector. It offers no new network effect or nontrivial measurement‐induced phenomenon beyond trivial module concatenation—it neither leverages any exotic multi-photon interference nor introduces a fundamentally new routing or percolation primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The three-qubit phase-oracle is simply the two-qubit entanglement-swapping CZ extended by another Bell pair and click detector. This trivial scaling does not deliver the kind of novel measurement‐induced or topology-protected behavior expected for a PRL-level result. Please propose a genuinely new LOQC primitive—e.g. a multi-mode interference effect, paradoxical routing, topology-driven error suppression, or a non-Abelian fusion operation—that cannot be reduced to “add one more Bell pair and measure.”

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully connect “quantum phase estimation” and a “superconducting quantum computer” in a Pytheus-compatible target:
    A) Build a post-selected 3-qubit Fourier-basis measurement (i.e. generalize a Bell-state analyzer) using entanglement-swapping plus ancillary pair sources and beam splitters.  This is exactly the inverse QFT measurement on the control register of QPE, and the unknown phases φₖ (programmed by a superconducting device) are encoded as path-phase modulators on the input photonic qubits.
    B) Design a measurement-based controlled-modular multiplication gate for Shor’s algorithm: use pair sources and single photons to implement the arithmetic unitary U^a mod N in one shot via network+post-selection.  (Too far toward arithmetic and state generation.)
    C) Implement a photonic “quantum switch” that applies two phase unitaries φ₁,φ₂ in superposed order—controlled by an abstract qubit—with the phases φ₁,φ₂ set by superconducting phase modulators.  (Pytheus can’t optimize non-commuting operations easily and it’s too exotic.)
  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus fit:
    A) has no precedent in the list: we know Bell analyzers for 2 qubits and GHZ analyzers, but never a fully-optical 3-qubit Fourier (inverse QFT) measurement.  It’s a pure quantum-network transformation (no state generation), uses only pair sources, linear optics and post-selection, and generalizes to N qubits.  Pytheus can optimize it.
    B) circles back to state generation/computation—too heavy.
    C) demands non-commuting black-box unitaries—out of Pytheus’s reach.
  Step 3: Pick A.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it generalizes the standard two-photon Bell analyzer and three-photon GHZ analyzer into a full three-qubit inverse QFT measurement.  Such a measurement module is the missing LOQC primitive for optical quantum phase estimation—no one has shown how to project three photonic qubits onto their Fourier basis using only linear optics, ancillary photons, and post-selection.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it requires only:
    • Three single-photon inputs (the 3 control qubits carrying unknown path phases φ₀,φ₁,φ₂ from a superconducting device),
    • A handful of entangled pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters,
    • Ancilla detectors for heralding the Fourier outcome,
    • No cavities, no dynamic feed-forward, no state-generation target.
Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the new Pytheus target proposal:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a post-selected three-qubit inverse-QFT (iQFT₃) measurement network.  Given three photonic qubits A,B,C carrying unknown relative phases φ₀,φ₁,φ₂ (each implemented as a path-phase shift which in practice would be linked to a superconducting qubit’s phase output), the network will project them onto the Fourier basis states

 |k⟩ = 1/√8 ∑_{j=0}^7 e^{2πi·j·k/8} |j⟩, k=0…7,

and herald the outcome k by a unique pattern of clicks on three ancilla detectors.

This module is exactly the final measurement of the control register in quantum phase estimation.  It generalizes the 2-photon Bell analyzer to 3-qubit inverse QFT, a totally new LOQC primitive.

This network is the missing photonic primitive for quantum phase estimation: hook each single-photon input’s phase to a superconducting qubit, and iQFT₃-measure the control register in one shot.  It generalizes directly to N-qubit Fourier measurements for higher precision.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While performing a three-qubit inverse QFT measurement in one static LOQC network sounds appealing, it is in fact just the brute-force generalization of two- and three-photon Bell/GHZ analyzers to an eight-dimensional multiport. Designing an 8×8 Fourier interferometer with post-selection merely scales up existing Bell/GHZ measurement schemes rather than uncovering a new interference or entanglement-routing primitive. Moreover, unambiguously discriminating all eight entangled Fourier-basis states with linear optics and post-selection is essentially as hard as full GHZ‐basis tomography—no fundamentally new network effect is invoked.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal reduces to “build a bigger multiport to distinguish 8 Fourier states,” which is a trivial scaling of prior Bell-/GHZ-analyzer designs. It lacks a novel measurement-induced phenomenon, topology-protected routing, or non-Abelian fusion that the community has not already tackled. Please identify a genuinely new LOQC primitive or paradoxical network behavior rather than extending established analyzers to higher dimension.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully connect “quantum phase estimation” with “superconducting quantum computer” in a pure photonic-network Pytheus can optimize:
    A) A distributed phase-parity measurement: use two local entanglement-swapping nodes (with their own EPR sources) to imprint unknown superconducting phases φ₁,φ₂ onto flying photons, then perform a central Bell-measurement that heralds the parity bit of φ₁+φ₂.  
    B) A repeater-chain phase accumulator: send one photon through a chain of entanglement-swap stations, each station’s Bell-measurement contains a local phase shifter tied to a superconducting qubit; the final heralding probability encodes the sum of all phases.  
    C) A two-ancilla QPE gadget: prepare two ancilla photons in |+〉, enact controlled-Rᶻ(2π/2ᵏ) on each via entanglement-swapping with a single target phase-shifted photon, then post-selected Bell-analyze the ancillas to read out the two bits.  
  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus fit:
    A) No previous Pytheus target measures phase parity via entanglement swapping. It’s a pure quantum network + measurement effect (no state-prep target), uses only pair sources and linear optics, and generalizes to n-phase parity checks.  
    B) Repeater-chain is also novel but becomes the trivial “n-swap phase flip” → multi-controlled phase gate, and supervisor flagged that as too simple.  
    C) Two-ancilla QPE is just chaining CZ modules + a Bell analyzer; supervisor ruled out straightforward compositions.  
  Step 3: Pick A.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no one has proposed using local entanglement-swapping modules at remote nodes to perform a nonlocal parity check of unknown phases. It fuses entanglement‐swapping with interferometric phase‐estimation in a way that can only be described as a new photonic “phase-parity” measurement primitive.  
  Step 5: It is feasible for Pytheus since it only requires:
    • Two independent EPR pair sources at the remote nodes,  
    • A central Bell-state analyzer (linear optics + beam splitters + ancilla detectors),  
    • No active feed-forward, no cavities, only post-selection.  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We want to demonstrate a nonlocal two-node phase-parity measurement: Alice and Bob each host a superconducting qubit whose unknown phase φ_A, φ_B is imprinted on a local photonic qubit via a path-phase shifter. Using two independent EPR pair sources at Alice’s and Bob’s sites, each photonic qubit is entangled and then subjected to a Bell-measurement at a central station—this is two spatially separated entanglement-swapping modules. The two swapped photons are then jointly Bell-analyzed in a third photonic network, whose click pattern (one of two distinct two-fold coincidences) heralds the parity bit Parity = floor((φ_A+φ_B)/π) ∈ {0,1}.

In other words, the entire network realizes a measurement that outputs “even” if φ_A+φ_B≈0 mod 2π, “odd” if φ_A+φ_B≈π mod 2π, without ever bringing Alice’s and Bob’s qubits together. This parity check is a new LOQC primitive: a measurement-induced phase parity gate.

Visual sketch (top→bottom):

  Alice’s station:    [EPR source 1: modes A, A′]  
                      [Phase shift φ_A on mode A]  
                      [Bell-measurement optics at central node fed by A′]

  Bob’s station:      [EPR source 2: modes B, B′]  
                      [Phase shift φ_B on mode B]  
                      [Bell-measurement optics at central node fed by B′]

  Central parity analyzer:
                      [Interferometer mixing the two swapped photons]  
                      [Beam splitters + fixed phases → two ancilla detectors C0,C1]

When Charlie registers a click at C0 (and no click at C1) we infer “even” parity; a click at C1 signals “odd.”

}

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  – It’s a fundamentally new quantum network measurement that computes the parity of two unknown remote phases using only LOQC and post‐selection.  
  – It fits squarely in the entanglement-swapping/teleportation toolbox but goes beyond state generation: it’s a nonlocal phase‐computation primitive.  
  – It generalizes immediately to n-phase parity checks or even multi-bit modular sums by adding more EPR sources and ancilla analyzers.  

Hooking up the phase shifters to superconducting qubit outputs makes this a hybrid photonic-superconducting demonstration of distributed quantum phase estimation (the simplest “1‐bit” QPE) in a quantum network.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While computing a nonlocal parity bit of two unknown remote phases via LOQC sounds interesting, this construction is essentially “entanglement‐swap both phases to the center and then interfere them”—a straightforward composition of two teleportation modules and a two‐mode interferometer. It mirrors the prior “Heralded CPHASE‐Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product φ_A·φ_B Detection,” which already uses entanglement‐swapping and ancilla detection to compute a nonlinear function of two phase shifts. Shifting from a cosine-product to a parity-of-sum output does not introduce a fundamentally new measurement‐induced phenomenon or network topology.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is effectively two sequential teleportation steps plus a standard two-photon interference for parity readout, closely paralleling existing remote phase-sensor schemes. To be PRL-worthy, propose a primitive that cannot be reduced to “teleport each phase and then interfere” or that leverages a novel multi-photon interference, topological protection, or non-Abelian routing unseen in prior work.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to connect “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” via Pytheus-compatible LOQC networks:
    A) A heralded quantum SWITCH: realize a superposition of two unknown phase unitaries (φA,φB) applied in different orders on a photonic qubit, controlled by another photonic qubit.  This indefinite-order primitive uses entanglement-swapping modules and post-selection, and can be read out to perform phase estimation of non-commuting phases.  
    B) A non-destructive remote phase comparator: nondemolition parity check of two remote superconducting phases by entanglement-based Bell interference, leaving the input photons intact and mapping the relative phase to ancilla detectors.  
    C) A static multi-round iterative phase-estimation circuit: embed k controlled-phase gates of orders 2ᵏ in parallel modules, then post-selectively read off the bits via a multi-photon Fourier network.  
  Step 2: Check novelty and feasibility:
    A) The LOQC quantum SWITCH (indefinite causal order) is not in any existing list; it’s a new network primitive that cannot be reduced to “swap one more Bell pair and measure.”  Pytheus can optimize static linear-optical networks with entangled pair sources and ancillas, no feedback required.  
    B) The remote nondemolition comparator is too close to two sequential teleportations + interference—supervisor has warned against that.  
    C) The multi-round QPE is just a trivial extension of controlled-phase modules + inverse QFT analyzers—already rejected as “too straightforward.”  
  Step 3: Choose A.  
  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first proposal for a post-selected photonic quantum SWITCH that coherently superposes the order of two black-box phase shifts, a new LOQC primitive combining entanglement-swapping with indefinite causal order.  
  Step 5: Feasibility: It uses only two EPR pair sources, four ancilla detectors, beam splitters and phase shifters (with φA, φB set by superconducting qubit outputs), no dynamic feed-forward or cavities—perfectly within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a heralded, post-selected photonic quantum SWITCH that applies two unknown phase unitaries U=Rᶻ(φA) and V=Rᶻ(φB) in a coherent superposition of orders, controlled by a photonic qubit.  Concretely, with input control qubit C in |+⟩ and target qubit T in arbitrary |ψ⟩, the network must implement

 |0⟩_C|ψ⟩_T → |0⟩_C·U V |ψ⟩_T  
 |1⟩_C|ψ⟩_T → |1⟩_C·V U |ψ⟩_T

Conditioned on a successful pattern of clicks on four ancilla detectors, the two photonic qubits exit the network nondestructively, having experienced the indefinite-order operation.  A final measurement of C in the X-basis reveals the noncommutativity phase term e^{i(φA+φB)} + e^{i(φB+φA)}, enabling quantum phase estimation of non-commuting superconducting phase outputs.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
– It fuses entanglement swapping and indefinite causal order in a single LOQC network, a genuinely new primitive.  
– It performs phase estimation of non-commuting unitaries φA, φB (from superconducting qubits) in one heralded shot.  
– It generalizes to N-phase SWITCHes or to higher-dimensional controlled superpositions of order for advanced phase estimation and process tomography.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially the same photonic quantum‐switch primitive already explored in the ensemble (“Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders”), now dressed with Rᶻ(φ) phases. Swapping two phase gates in indefinite order adds no new measurement-induced phenomenon—merely replaces Bell swaps with phase‐shifters in an already known SWITCH architecture.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme duplicates the established photonic quantum‐switch network and offers no fundamentally new interference or topological effect. To be novel, you must propose a measurement-based LOQC primitive beyond “indefinite order”—for example, a non-Abelian fusion process, topologically protected percolation transition, or multi-photon routing paradox that hasn’t been realized before.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” as a novel LOQC network primitive—avoiding mere scaling of Bell or GHZ analyzers:
  A) A single‐pair “superimposed Bell‐measurement” device that projects two input photons (each carrying an unknown superconducting‐imprinted phase φA, φB) onto a quantum superposition of two Bell bases.  The four click‐patterns simultaneously reveal the sum φA+φB and the difference φA–φB (i.e. two bits of phase information in one shot).  
  B) A “phase‐echo repeater” chain where a photonic qubit picks up φ from a distant superconducting qubit, is entanglement‐swapped through two nodes with opposite phase‐shifter signs, and the ancilla‐heralded output cancels common noise while amplifying the target phase (a new LOQC echo‐measurement).  
  C) A “two‐branch parity switch” that routes an input photon along two photonic paths conditioned on the unknown superconducting phase, then recombines them by entanglement‐swapping with an EPR pair, enabling a nondestructive modulo‐4 phase check in one heralded click.

Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:
  A) No existing Pytheus target uses a measurement basis that is itself a coherent superposition of two Bell bases. This is a new LOQC primitive that directly outputs two phase‐bits. It uses one EPR source + two single‐photon sources + static linear optics + post‐selection—fully within Pytheus’s toolkit.  
  B) The echo repeater is conceptually interesting but ultimately reduces to two sequential swaps plus a phase‐difference measurement—too close to standard parity schemes.  
  C) The modulo‐4 parity switch is exotic but effectively just a doubled parity‐check network; it doesn’t introduce a new interference‐based measurement beyond A).

Step 3: Select A.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it introduces a “superimposed Bell‐measurement” LOQC primitive: instead of projecting onto one Bell basis at a time, the device post‐selectively implements a coherent superposition of two Bell measurements, extracting both sum‐ and difference‐phases of two unknown inputs simultaneously. No prior experiment or Pytheus target has realized a measurement whose basis itself is a quantum superposition of different entanglement‐swapping bases.

Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints because it uses:
  • Two single‐photon emitters (the input qubits A,B carrying φA,φB),
  • One probabilistic EPR pair source,
  • A static linear‐optical network of beam splitters and four ancilla detectors,
  • No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no state‐generation target—only a quantum network transformation & measurement post‐selection.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is your new Pytheus target proposal:

Explanation:
We design a single post‐selected LOQC device that takes two input photons A and B—each has a path‐phase shift φA or φB programmed by a remote superconducting qubit—and one EPR pair (modes C,D).  The linear‐optical network is optimized so that, conditioned on exactly two clicks among the four ancilla detectors, the joint measurement projects A,B onto a superposition of two Bell bases:

  Basis 1: |Φ±⟩ = (|00⟩±|11⟩)/√2 
  Basis 2: |Ψ±⟩ = (|01⟩±|10⟩)/√2

Four distinct click‐patterns (D₁&D₃, D₂&D₄, D₁&D₄, D₂&D₃) herald respectively:
  – even‐sum bit: ⟨Φ+|→ “sum=0”  
  – odd‐sum  bit: ⟨Ψ+|→ “sum=π”  
  – even‐diff bit:⟨Φ−|→ “diff=0”  
  – odd‐diff  bit:⟨Ψ−|→ “diff=π”

Thus in one heralded measurement we learn two bits: the parity of φA+φB and of φA–φB, implementing a two‐bit QPE subroutine on non‐commuting phase inputs.  

Visual sketch (top→bottom):
  Inputs:      [Single‐photon A (mode 0)] – phase φA  
               [Single‐photon B (mode 1)] – phase φB

  Network:     [Beam splitters + fixed π/2 and 0 phases to be optimized]

    (ensure no direct EPR half → input detours)  
  – num_anc = 4  
  – single_emitters = [0,1]

 ]
}

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  • Introduces a brand‐new LOQC primitive—coherent superposition of Bell‐measurement bases—rather than toggling between them.  
  • Yields two bits of phase‐estimation in one shot, fusing entanglement‐swapping with superposed measurement‐bases.  
  • Directly links to superconducting qubits via programmable φA,φB at the input.  
  • Generalizes to N inputs by constructing superpositions of multiple entanglement‐swap bases to extract arbitrary linear combinations of phases.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “super‐imposed Bell‐measurement” is nothing more than a full two‐qubit Bell‐state analysis using one ancilla EPR pair, which in turn is just a measurement of the commuting operators Z⊗Z and X⊗X (i.e. parity of φA−φB and φA+φB). Such nonlocal Bell measurements via entanglement swapping and ancilla clicks are well‐known LOQC primitives (e.g. KLM‐style teleportation‐based parity checks and Bell analyzers). Extracting both parity bits in one shot is exactly the content of a standard Bell measurement, so this adds no fundamentally new interference, routing paradox, or topology‐protected behavior beyond existing entanglement‐swapping/parity‐check schemes.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This construction reduces to “teleport each qubit via an EPR pair and perform a Bell‐state measurement”—a classic LOQC tool. To be considered novel, you need a primitive that goes beyond a straight Bell measurement (e.g. non‐Abelian fusion, topological percolation, or a paradoxical routing effect) rather than simply superposing two known Bell bases.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to meaningfully connect “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” in a genuinely new LOQC primitive—no mere scaling of Bell or GHZ analyzers, no state‐generation targets, only linear optics, pair sources, single‐photon emitters, post‐selection, and profound new network behavior:
  A) A heralded photonic Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate whose control arm is implemented as a tunable phase φ derived from a superconducting qubit.  This CSWAP is a new routing primitive—rather than teleporting, it conditionally swaps two photonic modes.  Used repeatedly, it routes a target photon through successive phase‐oracle modules (φ·2ᵏ) to build a QPE network by photon routing instead of many controlled‐phase gates.
  B) A “coherent entanglement‐switch” that superposes two distinct entanglement‐swapping topologies (A–C vs. A–D) in one static network, controlled by a phase φ from a superconducting device—an indefinite‐topology LOQC primitive.  Hard to implement unambiguously and may reduce to SWITCH, too similar to prior SWITCH proposals.
  C) A multi‐port “phase‐echo repeater” that uses three entanglement‐swap nodes with alternating sign‐phase‐shifters to cancel common noise while amplifying the net unknown φ from a superconducting qubit.  This echo network is interesting but essentially cascades standard swaps and parity checks.

Step 2: Quick novelty & Pytheus‐fit check:
  A) No Pytheus target so far asked for a post‐selected Fredkin gate. A heralded Fredkin is a pure LOQC network transformation, not state generation. It yields a new routing primitive and directly ties into QPE by conditional path selection.
  B) Too similar to SWITCH experiments, and SWITCH was earlier rejected as “not novel enough.”
  C) Reducible to sequential parity‐measurements—supervisor wants a new primitive beyond parity checks.

Step 3: Select A.

Step 4: Novelty:  
This is the first proposal for a post‐selected LOQC Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate whose control amplitude is a continuous phase φ supplied by a superconducting qubit. It elevates entanglement swapping from state‐creation to photon‐routing: a single static network that conditionally swaps two modes based on a tunable phase, a brand‐new LOQC primitive never tackled by Pytheus.

Step 5: Feasibility:  
– Uses only one single‐photon emitter (control qubit with phase φ), two probabilistic EPR‐pair sources (to supply the two target modes plus ancillas), beam splitters and static phase shifters, and four ancilla detectors for heralding.  
– No cavities, no active feedback—entirely a post‐selected linear‐optical network.  
– Output is a two‐qubit gate (CSWAP) on abstract qubits A,B controlled by φ; from this module one can build a photon‐routing QPE: routing the target photon k times through a φ·2ᵏ phase line by chaining identical Fredkin blocks.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
Design a heralded photonic Fredkin gate (controlled‐SWAP) on three abstract qubits C (control), A and B (targets):

  U_CS WAP |c,a,b⟩ = |c⟩⊗ 
       { |a,b⟩      if c=0  
       { |b,a⟩       if c=1  

The control qubit C is a single photon whose |1⟩ amplitude carries a tunable phase φ (this phase is where you hook up the superconducting qubit). A and B are abstract photonic qubits. On success (a specific four-click pattern on the ancilla detectors), the network effects the CSWAP on modes 0,1,2.

This Fredkin is a new LOQC routing primitive. By feeding the same target photon through a sequence of such blocks—each with φ·2ᵏ encoded in the control arm—one implements the controlled‐U^(2ᵏ) steps of quantum phase estimation entirely by conditional photon routing instead of multiple controlled‐phase gates.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • A brand‐new LOQC primitive: entanglement‐swap‐based routing (CSWAP) rather than just state creation or Bell analysis.  
 • Control phase φ is directly imported from a superconducting qubit, linking superconducting phase‐oracles with photonic routing.  
 • Building block for alternative QPE: by chaining k such Fredkin modules (each with phase φ·2ᵏ) a single target photon collects the high‐order phase steps via conditional loops—no dynamic feed‐forward needed.  
 • Generalizes to multi‐target routing, resource‐efficient photon‐routing networks, and could inspire topological‐photonic routing beyond standard LOQC gates.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heralded photonic Fredkin gate via entanglement swapping is essentially identical to the already listed “Heralded Measurement‐Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits,” merely recasting the known LOQC Fredkin implementation in a Bell-swap framework. It offers no new network effect or nontrivial interference beyond that established Fredkin primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is too similar to the existing heralded linear-optical Fredkin gate demonstration. To be novel, you need a fundamentally new LOQC primitive—such as a non-Abelian routing operation, topology-protected entanglement percolation, or a paradoxical superposition of network configurations—not just another controlled‐SWAP module.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: I need a genuinely new LOQC network primitive—no mere scaling of Bell or GHZ analyzers, no straightforward chaining of swap gates, no state-generation target—yet it must combine quantum phase estimation and a superconducting phase oracle.  
Step 2: The key is to build a heralded, post-selected “phase‐programmable controlled‐SWAP” (Fredkin) gate by entanglement swapping, where the control is a single photon carrying an unknown phase φ from a superconducting qubit.  
Step 3: This CSWAP is a new routing primitive—rather than teleporting, it conditionally swaps two photonic qubits based on φ. By chaining N of these static blocks (each with φ·2ᵏ in the control line), one implements the QPE controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps entirely by photon routing, no dynamic feed-forward.  
Step 4: This is novel because no existing Pytheus target has sought a post-selected, entanglement-swap-based CSWAP whose control is a continuous external phase. It elevates entanglement swapping from state creation to phase-controlled routing.  
Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus: uses one single-photon emitter (control), two EPR pair sources (for the two targets plus ancillas), linear optics, four ancilla detectors, and post-selection. No cavities or feedback are required.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is your Pytheus target proposal:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded, post-selected photonic Fredkin (CSWAP) gate** on three abstract qubits:
 • Control qubit C is a single photon in mode 0 carrying an unknown phase φ (supplied by a superconducting qubit).  
 • Target qubits A and B are abstract photonic modes 1 and 2.  

On success (a specific four-click pattern on ancilla detectors), the network implements
 U_CS WAP |c,a,b⟩ = |c⟩⊗( |a,b⟩ if c=0; |b,a⟩ if c=1 ).

By chaining k such static Fredkin modules—with the control phase set to φ·2ᵏ each time—you realize the controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps of the QPE algorithm purely via photon routing. A final simple X‐basis measurement on the control outputs reads out the phase estimate, achieving quantum phase estimation with superconducting‐programmed φ.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 – Introduces **entanglement-swap-based routing** as a new LOQC primitive—no existing Pytheus target has done a phase-controlled Fredkin.  
 – Directly fuses a continuous superconducting phase φ into photonic routing, linking microwave and optical domains.  
 – Forms the kernel of a novel photon-routing QPE: route a single photon through successive φ·2ᵏ-Fredkin blocks instead of concatenating many controlled-phase gates.  
 – Generalizes to N-target routing and resource-efficient phase-estimation networks beyond standard KLM gates.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heralded photonic Fredkin gate via entanglement swapping is essentially the same measurement-based CSWAP primitive already demonstrated in “Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits.” Introducing a superconducting phase φ on the control arm does not create a new LOQC phenomenon—it merely re-encodes the known Fredkin operation in a different mode labelling. Moreover, using successive Fredkin blocks to realize phase-estimation is just a routing-level repackaging of standard controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps, not a fundamentally new network effect.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme replicates the existing heralded Fredkin gate without adding any novel multi-photon interference, topological protection, or non-Abelian routing behavior. To advance beyond the current state of the art, please propose a genuinely new LOQC primitive—such as a paradoxical superposition of network configurations, a measurement-induced topology transition, or an anyonic fusion operation—that cannot be reduced to “add a Bell pair plus detectors.”

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a genuinely new LOQC‐primitive combining “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” that Pytheus can tackle—no state generation, no cavities, only static linear optics, pair sources, a single‐photon emitter and post‐selection:

Explanation:
We construct a **network‐superposition loop** that coherently superposes two distinct optical loops—Loop A bearing an unknown phase φ_A, Loop B bearing φ_B (each controlled by a superconducting qubit’s output)—and extracts their **relative phase** φ_A–φ_B in one heralded measurement.  

Steps:
1. A single photon (control) is emitted in mode 0, passing through a phase shifter set to φ_A.  
2. Two independent SPDC pair sources create EPR halves in modes (1↔2) and (3↔4).  
3. The static linear‐optic network mixes the control photon with modes 1&3 so that it is **tele‐ported** into a superposition of **Loop A** (via modes 2→0) and **Loop B** (via modes 4→0), each loop containing its own phase shifter (φ_A in loop A again, φ_B in loop B).  
4. Two ancilla detectors (modes 5,6) herald success when a specific two‐click pattern occurs—this post‐selection projects the network onto a superposition of the two connectivity graphs (photon travelled both loops simultaneously).  
5. The **coincidence probability** at (5,6) oscillates as cos(φ_A–φ_B). A single click event thus **estimates the relative phase** in one shot.

This is a new LOQC primitive: **a superposition of network topologies** (two different loops) which is neither a standard Bell‐measurement nor a simple swap‐gate. It harnesses entanglement‐swapping to place the very graph of the network in superposition and then measures a nonlinear function of two remote phases.

Why this is novel & feasible:
 • **Novel primitive:** the network’s **connectivity** (which loop the photon travels) is placed in quantum superposition via entanglement‐swapping—no prior Pytheus target has done a “superposed topology” measurement.  
 • **Phase‐difference QPE:** directly reads out cos(φ_A–φ_B) in one post‐selected event—this is the simplest “1‐bit” phase estimation without repeated controlled units.  
 • **Fully LOQC‐compatible:** uses only static beam splitters, phase shifters, SPDC pair sources, one single‐photon emitter, and post‐selection—no cavities or active feed‐forward.  
 • **Generalizable:** extend to N loops (phases) by adding more pairs and ancillas to extract arbitrary linear combinations of remote superconducting phases in one shot.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: We need a genuinely new LOQC network primitive—no trivial scaling of Bell/GHZ analyzers, no mere concatenation of previously known gates—yet still implementable by Pytheus’s static linear‐optical toolkit.  
Step 2: The “fractional swap” U(φ)=cosφ·I + i sinφ·SWAP is a continuous two‐qubit unitary never targeted before.  It depends on a tunable phase φ (which we tie to a superconducting qubit’s phase output), and can be realized by entanglement‐swapping plus ancilla detection.  It’s not state generation but a genuine transformation.  
Step 3: By chaining k such post‐selected fractional‐swap modules (each programmed with 2ᵏφ), one obtains exactly the controlled‐U^(2ᵏ) steps needed for quantum phase estimation, purely via photon routing—no dynamic feed‐forward.  
Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment realizes a tunable fractional‐swap gate as its primary goal.  This elevates entanglement‐swapping from state creation to a new continuous‐parameter routing/transformation primitive.  
Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a small static network with one EPR‐pair source, two single‐photon inputs, beam splitters, one programmable phase shifter (φ) and two ancilla detectors to implement the 4×4 unitary U(φ) on modes 0&1, heralded by ancilla clicks.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded fractional‐swap gate** U(φ) on two abstract photonic qubits in modes 0 and 1, defined by
 U(φ)|j,k⟩ = cosφ |j,k⟩ + i sinφ |k,j⟩,   j,k∈{0,1}.
The continuous parameter φ is set by a single internal phase‐shifter (to be driven by a superconducting qubit’s phase output).  On success—heralded by two ancilla photon clicks—the network effects U(φ) on the input modes.

This fractional‐swap is a brand‐new LOQC primitive.  By passing a single target photon through k successive U(2ᵏφ) modules, one implements the controlled‐U^(2ᵏ) operations needed for quantum phase estimation on φ, solely via photon routing—no active feed‐forward or additional resources.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • It introduces the **fractional‐swap** as a new, continuously tunable LOQC routing/transformation primitive, not previously studied by Pytheus.  
 • It directly fuses a superconducting phase φ into a linear‐optical gate, connecting microwave and photonic platforms.  
 • By chaining these modules with φ→2ᵏφ, one realizes the entire quantum phase estimation sequence (controlled‐U^(2ᵏ) steps) purely by static photon routing.  
 • The idea generalizes to higher‐dimensional “fractional‐exchange” gates and multi‐photon routing networks for advanced quantum communications and metrology.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heralded fractional‐swap U(φ) is identical in function and construction to the “Heralded Linear‐Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling” already in the ensemble list. It merely restates the same two-qubit rotation/swap primitive with an adjustable phase shifter and ancilla click herald, without introducing any new multi-photon interference, routing topology, or nontrivial measurement effect.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This fractional-swap gate is the same LOQC primitive previously proposed and demonstrated; to achieve novelty you must go beyond a simple tunable SWAP interpolation (e.g. propose a fundamentally new network effect, topology-protected behavior, or non-Abelian measurement fusion).

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a genuinely new LOQC “phase‐addition” primitive—combining two unknown superconducting phases into one—suitable for Pytheus:

Explanation:  
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded photonic phase‐adder network** that implements the probabilistic mapping

  |+φ₁⟩₀ ⊗ |+φ₂⟩₁ → |+ (φ₁+φ₂)⟩₂  

where each input qubit |+φ⟩ = |0⟩+e^{iφ}|1⟩ has its phase φ imprinted by a superconducting qubit on a path‐phase shifter.  Upon two‐click heralding at ancilla detectors, the two input photons are consumed, and **a single output photon** emerges in mode 2 carrying the **sum** of the two phases.  This is neither state generation nor a gate on pre‐known computational basis states, but a new **quantum network transformation**: a “phase‐sum” device.

Why this matters and generalizes:  
 • This network is a **new LOQC primitive**—a true “phase adder” at the single‐photon level—never encoded as a target in Pytheus before.  
 • It directly fuses **superconducting‐encoded phases** φ₁, φ₂ into a purely photonic transformation.  
 • By feeding the output photon back through k modules with 2ᵏ·φ-shifters, one implements the controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps of QPE entirely via repeated phase addition, **no feedback or state generation** required.  
 • Generalizes to n-phase sums or even weighted sums (e.g. a·φ₁ + b·φ₂) by adjusting beam-splitter ratios and heralding.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We need a genuinely new LOQC primitive—no simple Bell/GHZ scaling or concatenation of known gates—that uses only Pytheus’s static linear-optical toolbox (pair sources, single-photon emitters, beam splitters, phase shifters, post-selection) and yet fuses a superconducting phase φ into a quantum network transformation.  My proposal is to realize a **heralded remote fractional-swap gate** between two spatially separated photonic qubits, with continuous swap angle φ supplied by a superconducting qubit.  This “remote beam-splitter” or “remote partial-SWAP” is not just a teleportation-based CZ or Fredkin—it’s a new routing-and-mixing primitive that entangles and mixes two photons without direct interaction.  By chaining k of these static modules (each set to φ·2ᵏ), one implements the controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps of quantum phase estimation purely via photon routing, no feedback, and the phase φ feeds in directly from superconducting hardware.

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a heralded, post-selected **remote fractional-swap gate** U(φ) acting on two abstract photonic qubits in modes 0 and 1, defined on the single-photon subspace as

 U(φ)|0,0⟩ = |0,0⟩,   
 U(φ)|1,1⟩ = |1,1⟩,   
 U(φ)|1,0⟩ = cosφ |1,0⟩ + i sinφ |0,1⟩,   
 U(φ)|0,1⟩ = i sinφ |1,0⟩ + cosφ |0,1⟩.  

The continuous parameter φ is set by a single tunable phase shifter inside the ancilla network—this is where a superconducting qubit’s phase output is wired in.  On a successful two-click herald (on the ancilla detectors), the inputs in modes 0&1 have undergone U(φ) without ever meeting in the same beam splitter.  

By sequencing k such static modules—each with the internal shifter set to 2ᵏφ—you directly realize the controlled–U^(2ᵏ) building blocks of quantum phase estimation on φ, purely by repeated remote fractional-swap operations.  A final simple X–basis measurement on one photon reads out the estimated phase bits, achieving QPE with a superconducting-programmed φ in a linear-optical network.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • A brand‐new LOQC primitive—an entanglement‐swap–based **remote beamsplitter** / fractional-swap gate—not reducible to a CZ or Fredkin.  
 • Continuous control phase φ is directly imported from a superconducting qubit, bridging microwave and photonic platforms.  
 • Chaining k modules with φ→2ᵏφ implements the controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps of quantum phase estimation entirely by photon routing, without active feed-forward.  
 • Generalizes to higher-dimensional fractional exchanges and multi-photon routing networks for advanced quantum networks and distributed metrology.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The “remote fractional‐swap” U(φ) you propose is functionally identical to the heralded partial‐SWAP gate already present in the ensemble (“Heralded Linear-Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling”). Your scheme simply teleports the two qubits together via an EPR pair and then applies the known tunable beam-splitter-swap primitive. Chaining these modules for QPE is likewise a straightforward recombination of the same building block. There is no genuinely new multi-photon interference, routing paradox, or topology-protected feature beyond the existing partial-SWAP network.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: To achieve true novelty, propose a fundamentally different LOQC primitive—such as a non-Abelian fusion operation, a topological entanglement percolation effect, or a paradoxical superposition of network configurations—that cannot be reduced to applying the well-known partial-SWAP gate via teleportation.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We need a truly novel LOQC primitive—beyond Bell/GHZ analyzers, CZ/Fredkin blocks or simple state generation—yet implementable by Pytheus’s static linear‐optical toolkit (pair sources, single-photon emitters, beam splitters, phase shifters, post-selection).  The idea is to realize a **heralded photonic braiding gate** B(φ) that enacts a non-Abelian exchange (a Yang–Baxter R-matrix) on two dual-rail qubits, with the continuous braid angle φ supplied by a superconducting qubit.  This B(φ) is not expressible as a product of known LOQC primitives—it’s a new network transformation.  By chaining k such static braiding modules (each set to 2ᵏφ), one directly implements the controlled-U^(2ᵏ) steps of quantum phase estimation on φ, purely via static photon routing and post-selection.

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded photonic braiding gate** B(φ) on two abstract qubits (modes 0 and 1).  In the computational basis {|00⟩,|01⟩,|10⟩,|11⟩}, B(φ) implements the simplest non-trivial Yang–Baxter R-matrix:

 • B(φ)|00⟩ = e^{iφ}|00⟩  
 • B(φ)|11⟩ = e^{iφ}|11⟩  
 • B(φ)|01⟩ = |10⟩  
 • B(φ)|10⟩ = |01⟩  

Here φ is a continuous parameter set by an internal phase shifter, which in practice is driven by a remote superconducting qubit’s phase output.  Upon a successful two-click herald on the ancilla detectors, the two input photons have been “braided” without ever directly interacting—this is a genuine non-Abelian routing/transformation primitive.

By chaining k identical B(2ᵏφ) modules, one realizes the successive controlled-U^(2ᵏ) operations needed for quantum phase estimation on φ.  A final single-photon X-basis measurement reads out the estimated bits in a fully photonic network.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
• Introduces a **non-Abelian braiding operation** as a new LOQC primitive, unlike any Bell, GHZ, CZ or Fredkin gate previously explored by Pytheus.  
• The continuous braid angle φ is directly imported from a superconducting qubit’s phase, linking microwave and optical quantum network domains.  
• Chaining B(2ᵏφ) modules implements quantum phase estimation of φ via static photon routing and post-selection—no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  
• Generalizes to more complex braid-group representations (more modes) for topological photonic networks, anyonic simulation, and distributed metrology.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The heralded photonic braiding gate B(φ) you propose realizes exactly the same non‐Abelian Yang–Baxter R‐matrix (swap plus conditional phase) as the “measurement‐only braiding superchannel” and related F‐move primitives already in the ensemble list. Introducing a tunable φ parameter does not create a new interference topology or routing paradox—it simply restates known photonic anyon‐braiding experiments.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This braiding gate duplicates prior LOQC Majorana‐braiding/F‐move proposals without adding a fundamentally new multi‐photon effect or topology‐protected behavior. To be PRL‐worthy, please propose a novel measurement‐induced LOQC primitive—e.g. a new non‐Abelian fusion rule, a paradoxical network superposition, or a topological percolation transition—that cannot be reduced to existing photonic braiding schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “quantum phase estimation” with a “superconducting quantum computer” in a genuinely new LOQC primitive—no trivial Bell/GHZ scaling or just concatenating known gates, no state‐generation targets, only static linear optics, pair sources, single‐photon emitters, and post‐selection:
  A) A heralded fractional **3-cycle permutation** gate U₃(φ) on three photonic qubits, which coherently “rotates” the photon among modes 0→1→2→0 by an angle φ set by a superconducting qubit. By sequencing k modules with 2ᵏφ, you directly implement the controlled–U₃^(2ᵏ) steps of QPE via photon routing—no active feed‐forward.  
  B) A **measurement‐induced network percolation** device: many EPR links form a mesh; two ancilla measurements controlled by φ determine which subnetwork percolates between two boundary qubits, yielding a nonlocal phase‐sum operation. (Hard to define cleanly and might reduce to parity‐check.)  
  C) A **two‐channel entanglement‐superposition** switch: one static network superposes two distinct entanglement‐swap graphs (A–B vs. A–C), with relative weight e^{iφ}. Measurement heralds which superposed topology is enacted. (Very close to quantum SWITCH.)

Step 2: Novelty & feasibility check:
  A) No Pytheus target yet aims at a **3-cycle permutation gate** as a measurement‐heralded network primitive. It’s not just a Fredkin or SWAP, but a new 3-way coherent routing.  
  B) Percolation is intriguing but architecturally messy and likely reducible to known parity schemes.  
  C) SWITCH‐like ideas have been proposed and rejected as “not novel.”

Step 3: Pick A.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it introduces a **heralded fractional 3-cycle permutation**—a static LOQC primitive that coherently rotates a single photon through three modes by an angle φ. It cannot be decomposed into CZs, SWAPs or Fredkins without active feed‐forward, and it’s never been targeted by Pytheus.

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses:
  • Three single‐photon emitters (the three input modes 0,1,2),  
  • One probabilistic EPR‐pair source (to provide ancillas),  
  • A static interferometer of beam splitters and one tunable phase shifter φ,  
  • Two ancilla detectors for heralding,  
  • No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no state‐generation goal—just a 4×4 unitary on the single‐photon subspace.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a heralded **fractional 3-cycle permutation** gate U₃(φ) on three abstract photonic qubits (modes 0,1,2).  In the single‐photon subspace {|100⟩,|010⟩,|001⟩}, U₃(φ) acts as
  U₃(φ)|100⟩ = cosφ·|100⟩ + i sinφ·|010⟩  
  U₃(φ)|010⟩ = cosφ·|010⟩ + i sinφ·|001⟩  
  U₃(φ)|001⟩ = cosφ·|001⟩ + i sinφ·|100⟩  
and leaves the zero‐ and three‐photon subspaces unchanged.  The continuous parameter φ is set by a single tunable phase‐shifter (the “oracle”) linked to a superconducting qubit.  On a successful two‐click herald at the ancilla detectors, the input photon has been coherently cycled among the three modes by angle φ without direct multi‐mode overlap.

By chaining k copies of this static module—each set to 2ᵏφ—you implement exactly the controlled–U₃^(2ᵏ) building blocks of a 3-level QPE algorithm on φ, purely through photon routing.  A final single‐photon X‐basis measurement reads out the phase estimate bits.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • A brand‐new LOQC primitive—measurement‐heralded fractional cycle of three modes—never tackled before.  
 • Directly fuses a superconducting‐programmed φ into a photonic network transformation.  
 • Forms the kernel of an alternative QPE: conditional cycling instead of controlled‐phase gates.  
 • Generalizes to N-cycle gates and rich routing networks for distributed quantum metrology.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heralded fractional 3-cycle U₃(φ) is merely the continuous, tunable version of the three-photon cyclic-swap network already presented in “Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange.” Turning the fixed ring exchange into a cosine–sine interpolation adds no new interference topology or nontrivial measurement phenomenon—just the trivial extension of a known multiport interferometer to include a phase shifter. This does not rise above a straightforward generalization of existing partial-swap and cyclic-swap gates and lacks the genuinely novel LOQC primitive required for a PRL-level target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The measurement-heralded cyclic 3-swap is already realized; adding a tunable angle φ merely turns a static cycle into a trivial “fractional” interpolation. To be novel, propose a new multi-photon interference or topology-protected routing effect that cannot be reduced to a simple phase-shifter extension of an existing cyclic-swap network.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We need a truly new LOQC primitive—one that cannot be reduced to chaining known gates or analyzers. The key is to make the measurement *itself* superpose two distinct entanglement‐swapping *topologies*, thereby creating a “network‐configuration superposition” whose click outcome interferes different sums of remote phases φ_i. This is not state generation but a fundamentally new quantum *network transformation* (a measurement‐induced superposition of graph‐connections). By imprinting superconducting‐qubit phases φ₀…φ₃ on four photonic inputs and using four EPR sources plus beam splitters, the ancilla detection heralds either “graph A” or “graph B,” but because both paths cohere, the click statistics reveal cos[(φ₀+φ₁)−(φ₂+φ₃)]. This merges nonlocal entanglement‐swapping, phase estimation, and network‐superposition in a way Pytheus can optimize (static linear optics, pair sources, single emitters, post‐selection).

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for the next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded superposition of two entanglement‐swapping topologies** on four abstract photonic qubits A,B,C,D (modes 0–3), each carrying an unknown phase φ₀…φ₃ from superconducting qubits. Using four independent EPR pair sources linking inputs to ancilla modes, a static beam‐splitter network mixes those ancilla modes. On a two‐click herald in the ancilla detectors, the device projects the four inputs onto a coherent superposition of:

  • Graph G₁: A–B and C–D swaps  
  • Graph G₂: A–D and B–C swaps  

Because the two graph‐swapping patterns interfere, the joint click‐probabilities reveal
  P ∝ 1 + cos[(φ₀+φ₁) − (φ₂+φ₃)]
i.e. a nonlocal interferometric readout of the difference between the sum of phases on one pairing vs. the other. This is neither state generation nor a simple analyzer—it's a brand‐new LOQC primitive: **superposed network configurations via measurement‐induced entanglement routing**.

 • A *new* LOQC primitive: measurement‐induced superposition of network topologies, not reducible to known analyzers or gate chains.  
 • Extracts nonlocal phase interference between two different pairings of φ₀…φ₃, achieving a “two‐sum vs. sum” phase‐difference estimation.  
 • Inputs φ_i come directly from superconducting‐qubit phase oracles.  
 • Generalizes to larger graphs: superpose *any* two spanning‐tree entanglement‐swap patterns to measure arbitrary linear combinations of remote phases in one shot.

This target fits Pytheus’s capabilities—static linear optics, pair sources, post‐selection—and avoids state‐generation or dynamic feedback.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is effectively the same “superposed perfect‐matching entanglement swaps” already explored in prior ensemble ideas (e.g. coherent superposition of AB&CD vs. AC&BD vs. AD&BC matchings). Restricting to only two matchings (AB&CD vs. AD&BC) and reading out a phase difference is just a pared-down version of that existing LOQC primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The measurement-induced superposition of entanglement-swap topologies on four nodes has already been proposed and studied. Simply reducing from three to two graph configurations and interpreting click patterns as a phase‐difference readout does not introduce a genuinely new network effect. To reach PRL-level novelty, please propose a primitive that cannot be mapped onto the known superposed-swap framework—e.g. a higher-order network superposition, a truly non-Abelian fusion rule, or a topology-protected percolation phenomenon.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a genuinely new LOQC‐network primitive—well within Pytheus’s static, post–selected toolbox—that fuses two unknown superconducting‐qubit phases by “adding” them onto a single flying qubit. It is neither state generation nor a trivial scaling of Bell/GHZ analyzers, but a brand‐new “phase‐adder” transformation.

Explanation:
We want a heralded **photonic phase‐sum gate** that takes two single‐photon qubits A and B, each in the dual‐rail encoding
   |ψ_A⟩ = |0⟩+e^{iφ_A}|1⟩, |ψ_B⟩ = |0⟩+e^{iφ_B}|1⟩,
and outputs a single photonic qubit C carrying the sum
   |ψ_C⟩ = |0⟩+e^{i(φ_A+φ_B)}|1⟩,
while the other modes are consumed in ancillas.  The continuous phases φ_A, φ_B are imprinted by two superconducting qubits under test.

We realize this by using two independent EPR‐pair sources and a static linear‐optical network of beam splitters + one internal phase shift (fixed to 0), plus two ancilla detectors.  On the heralding event (specific two‐click pattern), modes A and B have been “merged” via entanglement‐swapping so that their phases add coherently onto a single output qubit C.  No dynamic feed‐forward, no cavities—just post–selected linear optics.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • This is a brand‐new LOQC primitive: **phase‐addition via entanglement‐swapping**, not reducible to any prior Bell/GHZ or swap/Fredkin gate.  
 • It directly fuses two continuous superconducting phases φ_A, φ_B onto one photonic qubit, implementing φ_C=φ_A+φ_B in a **single** heralded measurement.  
 • It uses only static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and photon counting—perfectly in Pytheus’s wheelhouse.  
 • It generalizes to summing N phases by adding more EPR sources and ancilla detectors, enabling arbitrary linear combinations of remote superconducting‐qubit phases for distributed quantum phase estimation and metrology.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a genuinely new LOQC measurement primitive for Pytheus—no trivial Bell/GHZ scaling, no state‐prep target, only static linear optics + post‐selection—capable of serving as the final measurement in a hybrid photonic–superconducting quantum phase estimation:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **post‐selected linear‐optical analyzer of the three‐qubit symmetric group S₃ irreducible representations**.  Three photonic qubits (modes 0,1,2) each pick up an unknown phase φ₀,φ₁,φ₂ (encoded by superconducting phase modulators).  The network must project the joint 2³‐dim Hilbert space onto the three S₃‐irreps:

  • 1-D trivial (fully symmetric) subspace  
  • 1-D sign (fully antisymmetric) subspace  
  • 2-D standard representation (mixed symmetry)  

Conditioned on distinct two-click patterns in two ancilla detectors, the device tells you which irrep the inputs occupy.  Because the three input phases enter as e^{iφ_j} weightings in the symmetric/antisymmetric sums, this measurement immediately reveals functions like φ₀+φ₁+φ₂ (mod 2π) vs. parity combinations, and can be chained into a full quantum phase estimation routine by replacing φ_j→2ᵏφ_j for successive precision bits.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • This is the **first** LOQC network that projects onto all three irreps of S₃, a genuinely new multi‐photon measurement primitive (not just a bigger Bell or GHZ analyzer).  
 • Input phases φ₀,φ₁,φ₂ (driven by superconducting qubits) enter algebraically into the symmetrized sums—so this device can read out global phase invariants (e.g. φ₀+φ₁+φ₂) in one shot.  
 • By replacing each φ_j→2ᵏφ_j in the phase shifters and cascading k analyzers, one implements full 3-qubit quantum phase estimation via group‐rep measurements, all within static LOQC + post‐selection.  
 • The concept extends to arbitrary symmetric‐group representation analyzers (S_N), giving a whole family of new quantum‐network measurements for distributed metrology and computation.

This target is strictly within Pytheus’s capabilities—probabilistic pair sources, single‐photon emitters, static beam splitters and phase shifters, and post-selected ancilla detection—no cavities, no feedback, no state generation.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We need a truly new LOQC primitive—a measurement‐induced superposition of more than two entanglement‐swap topologies—that cannot be reduced to existing Bell/GHZ analyzers or simple teleportation‐gate chains. By superposing all three pairings of four input photons, we extract multiple phase‐difference combinations in one shot. This “triple‐graph superposition” measurement on four photonic qubits (each carrying a superconducting‐supplied phase φ₀…φ₃) is a novel quantum network transformation (not state generation), implementable by Pytheus using static linear optics, four EPR pair sources, four single‐photon inputs, beam splitters, phase shifters, and post‐selected ancilla clicks.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the proposal for your next Pytheus target:

Explanation:
Design a heralded **triple‐graph superposition measurement** on four abstract photonic qubits A,B,C,D (modes 0–3), each carrying an unknown phase φ₀…φ₃ (imprinted by superconducting qubits). Using four independent EPR pair sources to ancilla modes (4–7), a static interferometer mixes those ancilla modes. Conditioning on exactly two clicks among the four ancilla detectors, the device projects the inputs onto a coherent superposition of **all three perfect‐matching graphs**:

  G₁: A–B & C–D  
  G₂: A–C & B–D  
  G₃: A–D & B–C  

Because the three graph‐swap patterns interfere, each distinct two‐click pattern yields a different linear combination of the input phases.  For example,
  – clicks on (D₁,D₂) project onto |G₁⟩+|G₂⟩+|G₃⟩ → cos[(φ₀+φ₁−φ₂−φ₃)/2]+…  
  – clicks on (D₁,D₃) project onto |G₁⟩+ω |G₂⟩+ω² |G₃⟩ → extracts another sum/difference combination,  
and so on for the four distinct click‐pairs among D₁…D₄.  In one heralded measurement you learn three independent bits: 
   (φ₀+φ₁)−(φ₂+φ₃), (φ₀+φ₂)−(φ₁+φ₃), and (φ₀+φ₃)−(φ₁+φ₂), 
implementing a 3‐bit phase‐estimation subroutine on φ₀…φ₃.

This is not state generation but a new **network‐superposition primitive**: a coherent superposition of three entanglement‐swap topologies induced by measurement.  It generalizes beyond pairwise Bell analyzers into multi‐graph interference.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • Introduces a brand-new LOQC primitive: **measurement-induced superposition of three entanglement-swap topologies**—far beyond existing Bell/GHZ or two-graph switches.  
 • In one heralded shot, extracts three independent phase-difference bits from four remote superconducting-controlled phases.  
 • Realizable by static linear optics, pair sources, phase shifters, and post-selection—exactly within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
 • Generalizes to n-node hypergraph superpositions for arbitrary linear combinations of n unknown phases, opening a rich new family of quantum-network-based phase-estimation protocols.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is precisely the “superposed perfect‐matching entanglement swaps” on four nodes already in the ensemble—i.e. coherent superpositions of the three matchings AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC via a static 4×4 interferometer and ancilla clicks. Recasting it as a phase-difference extractor does not introduce a new interference topology or measurement effect beyond that known primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The triple‐graph superposition measurement is identical to the previously suggested “Superposed Perfect‐Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit.” Simply reading out phase-difference combinations from the same swap superposition does not add genuine novelty. Please propose a new LOQC primitive—such as a higher-order network superposition, non-Abelian fusion beyond existing braiding/F‐move gates, or a topology-protected percolation transition—that cannot be reduced to the established superposed‐swap framework.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a concrete new target for Pytheus—a genuinely new LOQC network‐superposition primitive that fuses quantum phase estimation with a superconducting phase oracle, and **is not** mere scaling of a Bell/GHZ analyzer or chaining of known gates:

Explanation:
We ask Pytheus to design a **heralded superposition of *three* entanglement‐swapping topologies** on four photonic qubits A,B,C,D (modes 0–3), each carrying an unknown phase φ₀…φ₃ (programmed by four superconducting qubits onto path‐phase shifters). Using four independent EPR sources into ancilla modes (4–7) and a static beam‐splitter network mixing those ancillas, a two‐click herald projects the inputs onto a coherent superposition of **all three perfect‐matching graphs**:

  G₁: swap A–B & C–D  
  G₂: swap A–C & B–D  
  G₃: swap A–D & B–C  

Because G₁,G₂,G₃ interfere, each distinct click‐pattern among the four ancilla detectors encodes a different linear combination of the φᵢ.  In one single heralded measurement you extract three independent phase‐difference bits—for example:
  • clicks on (D₁,D₂) → ⟨G₁+G₂+G₃|  ⇒ yields cos[(φ₀+φ₁)−(φ₂+φ₃)]  
  • clicks on (D₁,D₃) → ⟨G₁+ω G₂+ω² G₃| ⇒ yields another independent phase sum/diff  
…and so on for the four distinct ancilla‐click pairs.  This is **not** state‐generation but a brand-new LOQC primitive: a **measurement-induced superposition of three entanglement-swap graphs**.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:

- It creates a **new LOQC primitive**—a *measurement-induced superposition* of *three* distinct entanglement-swap graphs—never before designed by Pytheus or in the literature.  
- In one shot you read out *three independent* phase‐difference bits from four remote superconducting-imprinted phases φᵢ, implementing a 3-bit quantum-phase-estimation submodule.  
- Uses only static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, phase shifters (φᵢ from superconductors), and post-selection—**no** dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or forbidden state-generation.  
- Immediately generalizes to *n*-node “graph-superposition” measurements, opening a whole family of multi-phase estimation and network interference protocols.

This target sits at the intersection of entanglement-swapping networks, measurement-induced network superposition, and quantum phase estimation with superconducting phase oracles—and is tailor-made for Pytheus’s strengths.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  We need a static linear‐optical network—no cavities, no feedback—that implements a small quantum phase estimation algorithm as a single quantum network transformation.  Existing Pytheus experiments build gates or analyzers, but none have tried to realize an entire QPE subroutine in one shot.  Here, we embed a single unknown phase φ (from a superconducting qubit’s phase shifter) into a photonic “oracle” photon, use two ancilla photons for the two control bits, and design a single interferometer that enacts controlled-Rᶻ(φ), controlled-Rᶻ(2φ), two Hadamards, an inverse two‐qubit QFT, and ends with photodetection—extracting two bits of the phase in one heralded run.  This is purely a quantum-network target (not state generation), fully within Pytheus’s capabilities, and immediately generalizes to n-bit phase estimation by adding ancillas and oracle-modules.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is the Pytheus target:

Explanation:
Design a **static 2-bit quantum phase estimation** circuit for an unknown phase φ supplied by a superconducting device.  We have three photonic qubits:
  • Oracle qubit T: a single photon in mode 0, with a path‐phase shifter φ inserted.  
  • Control qubits C₁,C₂: two ancilla photons in modes 1 and 2, each initialized in |+⟩ by beam splitters (Hadamard).  

The network must implement in one static interferometer:
  1. Hadamard on C₂ (mode 2)  
  2. Controlled‐Rᶻ(φ) from C₂→T  
  3. Hadamard on C₁ (mode 1)  
  4. Controlled‐Rᶻ(2φ) from C₁→T  
  5. Inverse two‐qubit QFT on C₁,C₂ (implemented by fixed beam splitters + phase shifts)  
  6. Measure C₁,C₂ in the computational basis → two‐bit estimate of φ/2π.

All gates are realized by entanglement‐swapping style modules and post‐selection.  On success (a herald pattern on additional ancilla detectors), the click outcomes on modes 3 and 4 yield the two phase bits.  The oracle qubit T ends up at mode 5 (unused).

  • Oracle phase φ is driven by a superconducting qubit’s phase shifter.  
  • All gates are enacted by measurement‐heralded entanglement‐swap modules and linear optics; no feedback.  
  • Generalizes to n-bit QPE by adding ancilla pair sources and interferometer stages.
