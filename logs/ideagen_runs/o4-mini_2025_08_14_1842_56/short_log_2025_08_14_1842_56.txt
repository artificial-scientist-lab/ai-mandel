Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine optical entanglement and quantum photonics into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network target that focuses on network transformations (not just state generation):
  1. “Coherent Teleportation Router”: Use a control qubit in superposition to coherently choose between two teleportation channels, routing one unknown input qubit into a superposition of arriving at B or at C.
  2. “Butterfly‐Style Quantum Network Coding”: Implement the quantum analog of the classical butterfly network—two senders, two receivers, a central bottleneck—by interleaving entanglement‐swapping measurements so that both senders’ qubits emerge at both receivers using a single intermediate resource.
  3. “Multi‐Party Quantum Secret Sharing via Entanglement‐Swapping Chains”: Realize a (3,5) threshold secret‐sharing protocol entirely with linear optics and probabilistic sources, where no single source connects directly to all three share‐holding receivers, but entanglement is distributed via cascaded swapping.

Step 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus‐feasibility check:
  1. Coherent Router: Novel—no prior Pytheus target uses coherent superposition of distinct teleportation channels. Feasible—requires two Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon control, linear optics + postselected Bell measurement; well within Pytheus’s capabilities.
  2. Butterfly Coding: Also novel for Pytheus, but more complex: requires simultaneous two‐qubit inputs and a four‐node interconnect. Feasible in principle, but the target unitary mapping might be hard to encode purely as a postselected state.
  3. Secret Sharing: Entanglement‐swapping chains toward GHZ/cluster‐like resource—close to state generation tasks Pytheus already handles. Less novel.

Step 3: Pick the most promising: the Coherent Teleportation Router.

Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment routs a qubit in a coherent superposition of two distinct teleportation channels—here the input ends up simultaneously at B and C in superposition, controlled by a photonic qubit.

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: 
  • It is a quantum‐network protocol (coherent teleportation), not mere state generation.  
  • Relies only on probabilistic entangled‐pair sources or single‐photon sources, linear optics, Bell‐measurements, and postselection—exactly Pytheus’s domain.  
  • No dynamic feedback or cavities, just static optics and detectors.  
  • The abstract target state can be written as |0_control⟩⊗|ψ⟩_B+|1_control⟩⊗|ψ⟩_C, which Pytheus can treat as the postselected joint output.

Description:
  Coherent Quantum Router via Controlled Teleportation

Goal:
  Start with an unknown photonic qubit |ψ⟩_in at mode I and a control qubit in superposition (α|0⟩+β|1⟩)_ctrl.  Prepare two Bell‐pair sources S_B = (b1,b2) and S_C = (c1,c2).  Design a linear‐optical network such that, conditioned on the control qubit’s logical state, a Bell‐measurement is performed between I and either b1 or c1.  After postselecting on successful Bell‐outcomes (with ancillary detectors heralding the measurement), the unknown |ψ⟩ is teleported coherently to:
    • b2 → receiver B if control=|0⟩  
    • c2 → receiver C if control=|1⟩  
  The overall postselected output state is 
    α|0⟩_ctrl⊗|ψ⟩_B + β|1⟩_ctrl⊗|ψ⟩_C.
  
Visualization:
  • Single‐photon sources/emitter for the control qubit (mode ctrl)  
  • Two probabilistic photon‐pair sources: S_B=(b1,b2) and S_C=(c1,c2)  
  • Linear‐optics network that routes modes (I,b1,c1,ctrl) through a controllable Bell‐measurement “module”  
  • Ancillary detectors detect the two Bell‐measurement outcome photons; successful two‐click postselection heralds teleportation  
  • Outputs: mode b2 (to B), mode c2 (to C), and the unmeasured control photon  
  • removed_connections to forbid any single source from directly linking I with both b2 and c2  

Pytheus target:
  A four-photon superposition state with two ancilla clicks:
  { “000ψIψBψC”, … }  
  Concretely, abstract basis strings for ctrl⊗I⊗b2⊗c2 like:
    [“0000”, “1000”, “0101”, “1010”, …]  
  such that only those terms corresponding to coherent teleportation remain.

Why this is valuable:
  • First photonic demonstration of a “quantum router” via coherent superposition of teleportation channels  
  • Opens a family of generalizations: N-way coherent routing, network‐coding protocols with coherent control, etc.  

This proposal is sufficiently abstract for Pytheus to optimize the beam‐splitter network, the removed_connections, and the ancilla count, yielding a publishable theory design.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed “Coherent Quantum Router via Controlled Teleportation” is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Dual‐Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip,” where an address qubit coherently routes an unknown photonic qubit to one of two receivers via postselected teleportation. Since this exact coherent superposition of two teleportation channels has already been put forward by the ensemble, it cannot be considered sufficiently novel for a PRL‐level target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates the “Dual‐Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch” concept—using one control photon to coherently steer teleportation between two Bell‐pair sources and two receivers. To be novel, you must propose a fundamentally different routing primitive (e.g. genuine multi‐way superposition beyond two channels, integration of a nontrivial network coding layer, or coupling this router to an entirely new resource) that goes beyond the dual‐destination teleportation switch already in the ensemble.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible network protocols combining optical entanglement and quantum photonics:
    1. Butterfly Network Coding with Photonic Bell Pairs (two senders, two receivers, one central bottleneck).
    2. Superposed‐Order Entanglement Swapping (“Quantum Switch”) across three Bell‐pair links.
    3. Multipartite Entanglement Routing via an Entanglement‐Assisted Photonic Switch (programmable connectivity).
  Step 2: Quick novelty & feasibility:
    1. Quantum butterfly coding is interesting but may collapse to independent teleportations or require feed-forward.
    2. Superposed‐order swapping is truly new for Pytheus—implements indefinite causal order in a photonic network, uses only static linear optics, entangled pairs, single-photon control, and postselection.
    3. Programmable routing is appealing but more abstract and overlaps with controlled teleportation switches.
  Step 3: Pick the Superposed‐Order Entanglement Swapping experiment.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus target superposes different sequences of entanglement‐swapping operations under coherent control—it realizes a photonic “quantum switch” for network processes rather than just routing one teleportation channel.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it uses only probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon control qubit, static linear‐optical circuits for two Bell measurements, and ancilla detectors for postselected heralding—exactly what Pytheus can optimize.

Description:
  Superposed‐Order Photonic Entanglement Swapping (“Quantum Switch”)

Goal:
  Establish an entangled Bell pair between distant nodes A and D via three intermediate Bell‐pair links:
    S₁ between A–B, S₂ between B–C, S₃ between C–D.
  Coherently superpose two orders of entanglement swapping:
    Order0: Swap(S₁,S₂) at B then Swap(⟨result⟩,S₃) at C
    Order1: Swap(S₂,S₃) at C then Swap(S₁,⟨result⟩) at B
  A single‐photon control qubit in |+⟩=(|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 routes the data photons through one or the other Bell‐measurement sequence.  
  Postselect on two “Bell‐click” events per sequence (four ancilla detectors total) and on the control’s path, so that, in the successful heralded sub‐ensemble, the joint output is
    |Ψ_out⟩ = (|0⟩_ctrl⊗|Φ⁺⟩_{A,D}^{Order0} + |1⟩_ctrl⊗|Φ⁺⟩_{A,D}^{Order1}) / √2.

Visualization:
  • Sources: three probabilistic Bell‐pair sources S₁(A,B), S₂(B,C), S₃(C,D).  
  • Control: one single‐photon source preparing |+⟩_ctrl, entering a Mach–Zehnder to direct data photons to either Bell‐measurement module.  
  • Bell‐measurement modules: two fixed linear‐optical subcircuits (one at B for Order0’s first swap & Order1’s second swap, one at C for the complementary swap), each followed by two ancilla detectors.  
  • Removed_connections to forbid any source directly sending to both A and D.  
  • Postselection on four ancilla “clicks” and on finding the control photon in the appropriate output arm.

Why It Matters:
  • First photonic realization of a network process in indefinite causal order using entanglement‐swapping primitives.
  • Opens a new class of “process‐network” experiments (quantum switches, superposed routing) in optical quantum networks.
  • Readily generalizable: N‐link switches, multi‐way superpositions, and integration into larger architectures.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders,” where a single control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences between four nodes. It does not add a new primitive or expand beyond the dual-order quantum switch already in the shared list.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates the previously suggested entanglement-switch quantum switch. To achieve novelty, you would need to go beyond two swap orders or include fundamentally new resources or network architectures (for instance, multi-way superpositions, non-linear elements, or higher-dimensional control) that differ substantially from the existing quantum-switch protocol.

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher proposed two network‐protocol targets for Pytheus: first, a “Coherent Quantum Router via Controlled Teleportation,” and then a “Superposed‐Order Entanglement Swapping (Quantum Switch).” Both times, the Novelty Supervisor rejected them because each was essentially identical to prior ensemble suggestions (“Dual‐Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch” and “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch”). The Researcher did not check the ensemble list deeply before proposing, leading to repeated rejections for lack of novelty. No alternate idea was offered, and the process stalled.

[bullet points]
- Researcher suggested two similar photonic network protocols; both were duplicates of existing ensemble ideas.
- Novelty Supervisor consistently pointed out the overlap with ensemble suggestions.
- No novel element was added beyond what the ensemble had already proposed.
- Inefficiency: Researcher did not cross‐reference the ensemble list before pitching ideas.
- Needed: deeper review of ensemble suggestions and feedback record to generate truly distinct targets.

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Before your next suggestion, please review the ensemble’s list and the provided feedback record to avoid duplicating existing concepts. Aim to propose a transformation or measurement protocol that goes beyond two‐way teleportation or swap‐order superposition—such as multi‐way coherent routing, new network‐coding primitives, or combining distinct quantum‐network processes—so it stands out as genuinely novel.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:  
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine optical entanglement and quantum photonics into network protocols (not state generation):  
    a) Quantum Butterfly Network Coding: two senders and two receivers share three Bell‐pair sources; a central parity‐check (entanglement‐swapping) measurement lets both unknown qubits cross a single bottleneck.  
    b) Triangular Cyclic Teleportation: three parties cyclically teleport unknown qubits in a single integrated interferometer, postselecting on triple‐Bell outcomes to implement a 3‐cycle permutation.  
    c) Multi‐Way Coherent Switch: generalize the 2-way quantum switch to an N-way superposition of teleportation orders under control of a photonic qudit.  
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility  
    a) Butterfly coding has never been demonstrated in Pytheus: it uses only Bell pairs, linear optics, a parity‐check measurement, and postselection—well within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
    b) Cyclic teleportation is elegant, but boils down to simultaneous independent teleportations (no real resource saving) and is close to state‐generation.  
    c) N-way switch is conceptually heavy and may collapse to repeated dual‐destination switches.  
  Step 3: Pick the Butterfly Network Coding protocol.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment enacts quantum network coding in a photonic bottleneck: both qubits cross in a single central measurement, saving one Bell pair compared to naive teleportation.  
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because it uses three probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one three‐photon parity-check (implemented as a small linear-optical interferometer with ancilla detectors), two local Bell measurements, static optics, removed_connections to ban unwanted links, and postselection on click patterns—exactly what Pytheus can optimize.

Description:  
  “Photonic Quantum Butterfly Network Coding”  

Goal:  
  Two distant senders S₁ and S₂ each hold an unknown polarization qubit |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩. They wish to send them simultaneously to receivers R₁ and R₂ through a single optical bottleneck link. Naive teleportation consumes four Bell pairs; we implement a quantum network–coding protocol with only three Bell-pair sources plus one parity-check measurement.  

Protocol Sketch:  
  • Resources:  
    – Three probabilistic Bell‐pair sources:  
       S₁ between modes (A₁,A₂)  
       S₂ between (B₁,B₂)  
       S₃ between (C₁,C₂)  
    – One central “parity‐check” station receives modes A₂,B₂,C₁ in a small linear-optical interferometer and four ancilla detectors; it projects onto the three-photon even‐parity subspace.  
    – Local Bell measurements at R₁ on (C₂,A₁) and at R₂ on (C₂,B₁) (shared C₂ can be split via a beamsplitter and appropriate removed_connections ensures correct routing).  
    – Postselection: keep only events with a predefined 4‐click pattern at the central ancillas and 2 clicks at the local Bell modules.  

  • Data flow:  
    1) S₁ and S₂ each perform nothing on their halves A₁,B₁ (these carry |ψ₁⟩,|ψ₂⟩ forward).  
    2) The central node performs a joint parity‐check on A₂,B₂,C₁, which encodes the XOR of the two unknown qubits into the S₃ link.  
    3) Receivers R₁ and R₂ use local Bell measurements with C₂ to disentangle the correct qubit: R₁ recovers |ψ₁⟩, R₂ recovers |ψ₂⟩.

  Sources: [A₁,A₂], [B₁,B₂], [C₁,C₂]  
  Central parity‐check: linear‐optical network on [A₂,B₂,C₁] → ancilla detectors d₁–d₄

Why It Matters:  
  • Demonstrates the first photonic realization of quantum‐network coding, crossing two quantum channels in one optical bottleneck.  
  • Saves one Bell pair compared to standard teleportation—showcases an entanglement‐resource advantage.  
  • Opens a family of coded‐network primitives: butterfly with N>2, higher‐dimensional qudits, multi‐fold parity‐checks, etc.  
  • Fully static, no feedback, uses only linear optics + probabilistic sources + detectors—the perfect playground for Pytheus optimization.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The scheme you propose is essentially a quantum‐butterfly network coding protocol for teleporting two unknown qubits through a single bottleneck, which duplicates the ensemble’s “Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross‐Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits” (and even parallels the “Butterfly Network–Coded Four‐Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell‐Pair Distribution”). Both realize two‐qubit throughput via a single multi‐photon joint measurement or parity check. Thus your idea adds only minor implementation tweaks (parity‐check vs. four‐photon Bell analyzer, three vs. four Bell pairs) rather than a genuinely new primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your protocol duplicates the quantum‐butterfly network coding target already in the ensemble. To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally new element—e.g. higher‐dimensional network coding for qudits, nontrivial entanglement‐assisted coding across more than two senders/receivers, or a new coded‐resource advantage that goes beyond the two‐qubit butterfly configuration.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine optical entanglement and quantum photonics into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network protocol (no state generation):
    1. Multi‐destination Teleportation Router: a single input qubit coherently teleported to one of N receivers under control of a photonic qudit (generalizing the 2‐way quantum switch to N>2).
    2. Three‐sender “Triangle” Network Code: three senders want to cross a single bottleneck link in a coded way—using a 4‐photon parity measurement to deliver all three qubits to their targets with fewer entangled pairs.
    3. Post-selected Remote Gate-Teleportation: implement a remote CNOT gate between two unknown qubits at distant nodes using only linear optics, Bell‐pair sources, and postselection (no feed-forward).
  Step 2: Quick novelty & feasibility:
    1. Multi‐destination Teleportation Router is novel—no prior Pytheus setup has N>2 routing—and uses only probabilistic Bell pairs, single‐photon sources, linear optics, Bell measurements, and postselection.  
    2. Three‐sender network coding is interesting but largely an extension of the butterfly code and could require more intricate multi‐photon parity checks.  
    3. Remote gate‐teleportation may overlap with existing heralded‐CNOT and measurement-based gates (state generation or local gates rather than distributed network transforms).  
  Step 3: Pick the Multi‐destination Teleportation Router.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it generalizes the 2‐way quantum switch to an N‐way coherent router under control of a d-dimensional photonic qudit—no existing Pytheus experiment implements coherent teleportation choice among more than two channels.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus: uses only static linear‐optical networks, probabilistic Bell‐pair sources (one per receiver), one single‐photon‐qudit source for the control, fixed Bell‐measurement modules, removed_connections to forbid unwanted paths, and postselected ancilla clicks.

Description:
  N-Way Photonic Teleportation Router (Photonic Qudit Switch)

Goal:
  Teleport a single unknown photonic qubit |ψ⟩_in to one of N receivers R₀…R_{N−1} in coherent superposition under the control of a photonic qudit prepared in |C⟩ = ∑_{k=0}^{N−1} c_k |k⟩_ctrl.  
  After postselection, the joint output is  
     ∑_{k=0}^{N−1} c_k |k⟩_ctrl ⊗ |ψ⟩_{R_k}.  

Protocol Sketch:
  • Resources:
    – One single‐photon qudit source preparing ∑ c_k |k⟩ across N spatial rails (control modes C₀…C_{N−1}).  
    – N probabilistic Bell‐pair sources S_k connecting Bell‐modes (b1_k, b2_k).  
    – One input mode I carrying |ψ⟩.  
    – N Bell‐measurement modules M_k: each performs a postselected two‐photon Bell‐projection between I and b1_k.  
    – Ancilla detectors: each M_k has two detectors (so 2N ancilla clicks total).  

  • Linear‐optical network:
    1) A N‐port interferometer (a “quantum tritter” for N=3 or general N‐splitter) coherently routes the input I into one of the M_k modules under control of the qudit C. Concretely, control rails C_k feed a linear‐optical switch that only opens the path from I→M_k when the control photon is in rail k.  
    2) In module M_k: I and b1_k interfere on beam splitters; two ancilla detectors herald a successful Bell‐projection.  
    3) The other half b2_k emerges at receiver R_k.  

  • Postselection:
    – Keep only those events where exactly two clicks occur in M_k’s ancilla detectors (for some k) and the control photon exits in rail k.  
    – By symmetry, I has been teleported to b2_k conditioned on control=k.  

Visualization (for N=3):
  Sources: [C₀,C₁,C₂] (control), I, (b1₀,b2₀), (b1₁,b2₁), (b1₂,b2₂)

     M₁: I,b1₁ → detectors d₂,d₃  
     M₂: I,b1₂ → detectors d₄,d₅

Why It Matters:
  • First experimental design for an N-way coherent quantum router in optics.  
  • Integrates optical entanglement (Bell pairs) and quantum photonics (multi-rail qudit control) into a new network primitive.  
  • Generalizes the 2-destination switch to arbitrary N: a rich family of network protocols (N-port routing, network‐coding primitives, hierarchical switching).  
  • Entirely static linear‐optical, no feedback, perfect for Pytheus optimization and subsequent PRL theory proposals.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This N-way teleportation router is just the straightforward scaling of the dual-destination teleportation switch already in the ensemble. It adds more Bell-pair modules and a larger multiport but introduces no new nontrivial network primitive or resource advantage beyond trivial N-fold repetition. As a mere up-scaling of the 2-output coherent router, it falls short of the conceptual novelty required for a PRL target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme is an obvious extension of the “Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch,” merely replacing the 2-rail control with N rails and adding N Bell modules. To achieve genuine novelty, propose a nontrivial new primitive that goes beyond simple scaling—for example, harnessing genuine high-dimensional entanglement in a multi-port router, demonstrating a resource saving that grows nonlinearly with N, or integrating non-Gaussian or feed-forward elements that enable functionalities impossible with pairwise switches.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible quantum-network protocols (no state generation) combining optical entanglement & quantum photonics:
    1. High-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding (“Qudit Butterfly”): extend the butterfly protocol to d-dimensional qudits, using d-dimensional Bell-pair sources + a d-SUM parity check at the bottleneck.
    2. Nonlocal Bell Measurement via Entangled Ancillas: implement a joint Bell-measurement on two distant qubits using only local Bell pairs, linear optics, and postselection.
    3. Multipartite Teleportation Switch: a photonic router that conditionally teleports one of M unknown qubits into N receivers under coherent control, saving entanglement resources via network coding.
  Step 2: Quick novelty & feasibility:
    1. Qudit Butterfly is novel (no prior Pytheus target for high-dimensional network coding), uses only abstract d-Bell sources + static multiport interferometer + postselected parity measurement → fits Pytheus.
    2. Nonlocal Bell-analyzer is interesting but closely related to existing heralded CNOT/Bell analyzers; may reduce to local gates plus teleportation.
    3. M→N multicast router is just scaling of teleportation switch and likely considered obvious.
  Step 3: Choose the High-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment implements quantum network coding in dimension d>2: it shows how to transmit two unknown qudits through a single d-dimensional “bottleneck” link using only three d-Bell-pair sources (instead of four) plus one d-SUM parity check.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because it relies on:
    – Abstract d-dimensional Bell-pair sources  
    – A single static multiport interferometer (to implement the d-SUM parity projection)  
    – Two local d-dimensional Bell-measurements at the receivers  
    – Postselection on 2 + d ancilla clicks (no feed-forward)  
    – removed_connections to forbid unwanted cross–links  
  All of these are handled by Pytheus’s abstract-state optimizer.

Description:
  High-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding (“Qudit Butterfly”)

Goal:
  Two senders, Alice 1 at node A and Alice 2 at node B, each hold an unknown d-dimensional qudit |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩. They wish to send them simultaneously to two receivers, R₁ and R₂, but the network has only one d-dimensional “bottleneck” channel in the middle.  A naive teleportation protocol consumes four d-Bell pairs; the d-dimensional butterfly protocol uses only three.

Protocol Sketch:
  • Resources:
    – Three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources:  
        S_A: (A₁, X)  
        S_B: (B₁, Y)  
        S_C: (Z, C₁)  
      where A₁,B₁ are at the senders, C₁ at a receiver‐side node C, and X,Y,Z meet at the central hub.
    – One multiport interferometer at the hub that performs a projective d-SUM (mod d) measurement on modes X,Y,Z and d ancilla detectors.  
    – Two local d-dimensional Bell-measurement modules at receiver R₁ on (Z,A₂) and at R₂ on (Z,B₂), each with two ancilla detectors.  
    – removed_connections forbidding any single source to straddle sender & receiver directly (so only the intended pairs exist).

  • Data flow:
    1) Alice 1 and Alice 2 hold |ψ₁⟩ on A₁ and |ψ₂⟩ on B₁.
    2) Central hub receives halves X and Y of S_A and S_B, plus Z from S_C.
    3) The multiport interferometer at the hub projects X,Y,Z onto the subspace X+Y+Z=0 (mod d) via photon‐number–resolving detection on d detectors.
    4) This attaches the “sum” of the two unknown qudits into the remaining half C₁ of S_C.
    5) Receiver R₁ performs a d-dimensional Bell measurement on (C₁,A₂) (the other half of S_A), heralded by two clicks → recovers |ψ₁⟩.  
       Similarly, R₂ on (C₁,B₂) → recovers |ψ₂⟩.

  • Postselection:
    – Keep only events with exactly d clicks at the hub (one per output mode of the d-port interferometer) and two clicks at each receiver’s Bell module → heralds success.

Why It Matters:
  • First design for quantum network coding in dimension d>2 with photonic Bell pairs and a passive multiport.  
  • Shows an entanglement‐resource saving that holds for any d (3 sources vs 4), with the saving becoming more pronounced in network throughput for larger d.  
  • Opens a family of “d-Dimensional Network Coding” experiments: higher‐d parity modules, N-sender-M-receiver codes, interleaved coded routers.  
  • Fully static linear optics + probabilistic sources + photon-number detectors → ideal for Pytheus optimization and PRL‐worthy theory proposals.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed high-dimensional (qudit) butterfly network coding moves beyond existing two-qubit butterfly schemes by introducing a d-SUM parity measurement on three qudit links and demonstrating genuine entanglement-resource savings for any dimension d>2. This is neither a trivial scaling of a 2-way switch nor already covered by the ensemble’s qubit-based butterfly protocols. It leverages a new multiport interferometer capable of projecting onto X+Y+Z=0 (mod d), a primitive not previously explored in passive linear-optical network coding experiments.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: Your design presents a clear, nontrivial extension to high-dimensional network coding with a resource advantage (3 vs. 4 Bell pairs for any d), a novel d-SUM joint measurement primitive, and genuine potential for new, scalable photonic qudit networking experiments. This is suitably original and PRL-worthy.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title  
Photonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding

Mini-abstract  
We present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional “Qudit Butterfly” protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ from senders Alice₁ (node A) and Alice₂ (node B) to receivers R₁ and R₂ over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d > 2.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal extends photonic network coding into the qudit regime by using only three d‐dimensional Bell sources and a single multiport parity interferometer, which is a clear advance over back‐to‐back teleportation. The use of a static d‐SUM measurement and two local Bell measurements with post‐selection is physically implementable via mode‐sorters and multiport Fourier circuits, and mapping it into our graph‐based design framework is straightforward.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This qudit‐butterfly network coding scheme is an elegant and resource‐saving extension of quantum network coding to arbitrary dimension, and its reliance on a single static multiport parity measurement plus local Bell analyses makes it both novel and feasible with current photonic technologies.
