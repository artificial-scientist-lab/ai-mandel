    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements.

By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules.

Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Robust Photonic Qubit Teleportation via Topologically Protected Edge-State Entanglement in an SSH Ladder\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and implement teleportation of a photonic qubit from mode 0 to mode 7 across a two-leg Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger ladder by generating and post-selecting a Bell-state between the topologically protected edge modes (0 and 7). Using only linear optics\u2014probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla-mediated Bell measurements on weak bonds, and removal of unwanted connections\u2014we target the entanglement of end modes 0 & 7 to achieve disorder-resilient qubit transfer via multi-path interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: The proposal is essentially the standard quantum teleportation primitive\u2014using one Bell pair and a Bell-state measurement\u2014to transfer an arbitrary qubit state, here simply extended via a quantum transducer to superconducting qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

Pytheus can optimize a fixed multiport interferometer plus detectors; no feedback required.  \n  Step 3: Pick (c), the teleportation router.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it realizes a new quantum\u2010network primitive\u2014measurement\u2010induced routing of a quantum state to one of multiple solid\u2010state nodes\u2014using transduction plus linear optics, without dynamic switches.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it only uses single\u2010photon sources (the two transducers and two Bell\u2010pair sources), a static multiport interferometer, and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors; no cavities or feedback.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nExplanation:\nWe propose a \u201cquantum teleportation router\u201d linking three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes (A, B, C) via quantum transduction and a single linear\u2010optics measurement. An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network. Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors record one of two distinct heralding patterns\u2014pattern P_B heralds teleportation of \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 onto B\u2019s retained photon, pattern P_C heralds teleportation onto C\u2019s retained photon. No active switching is required; the routing choice is made by post\u2010selection.  \n\nVisualization (sources send photons downwards):\nsources:   [S_A]   [S_B]   [S_C]  \nnetwork:   [three\u2010input beam splitters + phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla detectors P1,P2,P3]  \nmemories:  [qubit B]  [qubit C]  \n\nWhen the detectors click in pattern P_B (e.g. clicks on D1+D2), \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 appears at B\u2019s memory; if they click in P_C (D2+D3), \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 appears at C\u2019s memory.  \n\nGeneralization:\n\u2022 Extend to N receivers by adding N Bell sources and routing via an N+1\u2010port interferometer.  \n\u2022 Use delayed\u2010choice routing by deferring which heralding pattern is selected for key\u2010agreement or multi\u2010party protocols.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation router: A\u2192{B or C} via transducers & static linear optics',  \n 'foldername': 'TeleportationRouter',  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1,2],      # 0=S_A, 1=S_B(idler), 2=S_C(idler)  \n 'num_anc': 3,                    # three ancilla detectors in the multiport  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1,2],             # 0=A\u2019s photon; 1,2=Bell photons sent for measurement  \n 'out_nodes': [3,4],              # 3=B\u2019s retained photon; 4=C\u2019s retained photon  \n 'target_quantum': ['000','100','011','111'],  \n   # Interpret '000' & '100' as patterns P_B routing 0\u2192B, '011'/'111' as P_C routing to C  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,3],[0,4]],  \n   # no direct source\u2010to\u2010memory link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops\u2014only static linear optics, probabilistic sources, and post\u2010selected heralding."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer.

The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Programmable Three-Destination Quantum Teleportation to the Choitarget State\n\nAbstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes \u221a\u03b1, \u221a\u03b2, \u221a\u03b3 across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve. By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology.

Consider adding nontrivial topological routing, higher\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping, multi\u2010node repeater features, or leveraging unique properties of the transducer in the network itself.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Explanation:\nWe propose a \u201cquantum teleportation router\u201d linking three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes (A, B, C) via quantum transduction and a single linear\u2010optics measurement. An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Programmable Three-Destination Quantum Teleportation to the Choitarget State\n\nAbstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes \u221a\u03b1, \u221a\u03b2, \u221a\u03b3 across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve. By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology.

Consider adding nontrivial topological routing, higher\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping, multi\u2010node repeater features, or leveraging unique properties of the transducer in the network itself.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Explanation:\nWe propose a \u201cquantum teleportation router\u201d linking three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes (A, B, C) via quantum transduction and a single linear\u2010optics measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

    "output": "Explanation:  \nWe propose a \u201cheralded entanglement switch\u201d for three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes A, B, C, interfaced via quantum transduction and a single, static linear\u2010optics station.  By post\u2010selecting on one of three distinct two-click detector patterns, the switch non-locally entangles exactly two of the three memories (A\u2013B, A\u2013C, or B\u2013C) without any active switching or state-generation routines.\n\nProtocol outline:  \n1. Each node (A, B, C) holds a superconducting qubit that is entangled locally with an emitted photonic idler via a Bell-pair source + transducer.  The \u201csignal\u201d photon remains stored in the node\u2019s memory; the \u201cidler\u201d photon is routed to the central station.  \n2. A fourth single-photon emitter provides an ancilla photon to balance the interferometer.  \n3. The four flying photons (idlers from A, B, C and the ancilla) enter a fixed 4-input linear-optics network of beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n4. Four photon-number-resolving detectors record exactly two clicks.  Which detectors click (patterns P_AB, P_AC, or P_BC) heralds which pair of memories has been entangled:  \n   \u2022 P_AB (clicks at D0 & D1) \u21d2 memories A & B are projected onto a Bell state;  \n   \u2022 P_AC (D0 & D2) \u21d2 A & C entangled;  \n   \u2022 P_BC (D1 & D2) \u21d2 B & C entangled.  \n   The ancilla photon simply ensures the correct interference conditions; its stored partner is discarded.  \n\nNo active switches, no cavities, no dynamic feedback\u2014only single-photon emitters (for the three idlers + ancilla), a static interferometer, and photon-number-resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

    "output": "Thought:  \nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to combine superconducting qubit nodes with quantum transduction in a purely network\u2010oriented target (no state\u2010generation):  \n  a) A standard A\u2192B teleportation channel via photonic transduction and a Bell\u2010measurement station.  \n  b) A linear\u2010optics \u201crouter\u201d that teleports a qubit from A to either B or C based on which detector pattern fires.  \n  c) A cyclic\u2010swap channel that simultaneously permutes qubit states \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081\u2192\u2082, \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2082\u2192\u2083, \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2083\u2192\u2081 between three superconducting nodes in one joint interferometric measurement.  \nStep 2:  \n  a) Too textbook.  \n  b) Interesting but close to previous \u201crouter\u201d proposals.  \n  c) Novel network primitive (3-cycle SWAP) not yet explored in Pytheus, and easily generalized to N-cycle permutation channels.  \nStep 3: Pick (c).  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it implements the primitive of a cyclic permutation (3-SWAP gate) across three distant superconducting qubits in one static photonic network, rather than just pairwise teleportation or entanglement swapping.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it only uses (i) three single\u2010photon sources to represent the transduced superconducting qubits, (ii) three probabilistic photon-pair (Bell) sources to supply the resource halves, (iii) a six-mode linear\u2010optics interferometer, and (iv) six photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no cavities, no active feedback, only post-selection on heralding patterns.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nExplanation:  \nWe propose a \u201ccyclic teleportation channel\u201d (a 3-cycle SWAP gate) between three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes A, B, and C, mediated by quantum transduction and a single static linear\u2010optics station. In one heralded run, A\u2019s state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081 is teleported to B, B\u2019s state \u2223\u03d5\u27e9\u2082 to C, and C\u2019s state \u2223\u03c7\u27e9\u2083 back to A, all simultaneously and without dynamic routing.  \n\nProtocol outline:  \n1. At each node X\u2208{A,B,C}, the superconducting qubit in unknown state \u2223\u03be\u27e9\u2093 is mapped to a photonic qubit via a quantum transducer (single\u2010photon source S\u2093).  \n2. Each node also hosts a local Bell\u2010pair source (probabilistic photon\u2010pair source P\u2093): one photon remains stored as the target memory at X; its partner (the idler) is sent to the central station.  \n3. The six flying photons (three from transducers S_A,S_B,S_C; three idlers from P_A,P_B,P_C) enter a fixed six\u2010input linear\u2010optics network (beam splitters + phase shifters) and are measured by six photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n4. A single successful click pattern\u2014for instance \u201cD0&D1, D2&D3, D4&D5\u201d (two clicks per teleportation)\u2014heralds that the three Bell measurements have all succeeded, resulting in the cyclic permutation: the memories at A,B,C now contain \u2223\u03c7\u27e9\u2083,\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081,\u2223\u03d5\u27e9\u2082 respectively.  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 N-cycle permutation channels among N superconducting nodes via an (2N)-port interferometer.  \n\u2022 Concatenate cyclic channels to form programmable network\u2010topology modules.  \n\u2022 Explore indefinite\u2010order permutations by coherent control over heralding subsets.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:  \n{  \n  'description': 'Cyclic teleportation (3-cycle SWAP) between three superconducting nodes via transduction and linear optics',  \n  'foldername': '3CycleTeleport',  \n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,  \n  'edges_tried': 40,  \n  'ftol': 1e-06,  \n  'loss_func': 'cr',  \n  'num_anc': 6,                     # six detectors at the Bell\u2010station  \n  'num_pre': 1,  \n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  'samples': 20,  \n  'single_emitters': [0,1,2],       # S_A, S_B, S_C: transduced qubits  \n  'in_nodes': [0,1,2,3,4,5],        # the six flying photons  \n  'out_nodes': [],                  # all photons are measured; memories are offline  \n  'heralding_out': [0,1,2,3,4,5],   # detectors D0\u2026D5 record clicks  \n  'target_quantum': ['110011','001100'],  \n      # e.g. clicks at {D0,D1,D4,D5} or {D2,D3,D4,D5} herald the cyclic SWAP  \n  'removed_connections': [],        # fully connected interferometer  \n  'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n  'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no dynamic feedback\u2014only deterministic single\u2010photon emitters (for transducers), probabilistic pair sources (for Bell resources), a static linear\u2010optics network, and post-selected heralding."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By combining three probabilistic EPR photon-pair sources, a programmable six-mode interferometer, and post-selected Bell measurements, this novel quantum-network primitive realizes fully programmable routing of unknown qubits without dynamic feed-forward or cavity resources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology. This does not meet our bar for a novel PRL\u2010worthy quantum\u2010optics experiment.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol. Consider adding nontrivial topological routing, higher\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping, multi\u2010node repeater features, or leveraging unique properties of the transducer in the network itself.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Explanation:\nWe propose a \u201cquantum teleportation router\u201d linking three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes (A, B, C) via quantum transduction and a single linear\u2010optics measurement. An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

In one heralded run, A\u2019s state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081 is teleported to B, B\u2019s state \u2223\u03d5\u27e9\u2082 to C, and C\u2019s state \u2223\u03c7\u27e9\u2083 back to A, all simultaneously and without dynamic routing.  \n\nProtocol outline:  \n1. At each node X\u2208{A,B,C}, the superconducting qubit in unknown state \u2223\u03be\u27e9\u2093 is mapped to a photonic qubit via a quantum transducer (single\u2010photon source S\u2093).  \n2. Each node also hosts a local Bell\u2010pair source (probabilistic photon\u2010pair source P\u2093): one photon remains stored as the target memory at X; its partner (the idler) is sent to the central station.  \n3. The six flying photons (three from transducers S_A,S_B,S_C; three idlers from P_A,P_B,P_C) enter a fixed six\u2010input linear\u2010optics network (beam splitters + phase shifters) and are measured by six photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n4. A single successful click pattern\u2014for instance \u201cD0&D1, D2&D3, D4&D5\u201d (two clicks per teleportation)\u2014heralds that the three Bell measurements have all succeeded, resulting in the cyclic permutation: the memories at A,B,C now contain \u2223\u03c7\u27e9\u2083,\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081,\u2223\u03d5\u27e9\u2082 respectively.  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 N-cycle permutation channels among N superconducting nodes via an (2N)-port interferometer.  \n\u2022 Concatenate cyclic channels to form programmable network\u2010topology modules.  \n\u2022 Explore indefinite\u2010order permutations by coherent control over heralding subsets.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:  \n{  \n  'description': 'Cyclic teleportation (3-cycle SWAP) between three superconducting nodes via transduction and linear optics',  \n  'foldername': '3CycleTeleport',  \n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,  \n  'edges_tried': 40,  \n  'ftol': 1e-06,  \n  'loss_func': 'cr',  \n  'num_anc': 6,                     # six detectors at the Bell\u2010station  \n  'num_pre': 1,  \n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  'samples': 20,  \n  'single_emitters': [0,1,2],       # S_A, S_B, S_C: transduced qubits  \n  'in_nodes': [0,1,2,3,4,5],        # the six flying photons  \n  'out_nodes': [],                  # all photons are measured; memories are offline  \n  'heralding_out': [0,1,2,3,4,5],   # detectors D0\u2026D5 record clicks  \n  'target_quantum': ['110011','001100'],  \n      # e.g. clicks at {D0,D1,D4,D5} or {D2,D3,D4,D5} herald the cyclic SWAP  \n  'removed_connections': [],        # fully connected interferometer  \n  'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n  'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no dynamic feedback\u2014only deterministic single\u2010photon emitters (for transducers), probabilistic pair sources (for Bell resources), a static linear\u2010optics network, and post-selected heralding.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This scheme duplicates the \u201cMeasurement\u2010Induced Photonic Realization of the Three\u2010Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring\u2010Exchange\u201d already in our ensemble.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal is essentially the standard quantum teleportation primitive\u2014using one Bell pair and a Bell-state measurement\u2014to transfer an arbitrary qubit state, here simply extended via a quantum transducer to superconducting qubits. While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology. This does not meet our bar for a novel PRL\u2010worthy quantum\u2010optics experiment.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

Node C: superconducting qubit \u2223\u03c6\u27e9_C is transduced into a photonic qubit (single\u2010photon source S_C).  \n3. Node B hosts two Bell\u2010pair sources P1, P2.

Two local Bell\u2010pair sources P_A at A and P_B at B each emit a photon pair: one photon stays as the memory at the originating node; the idler photons P_Aid and P_Bid travel to the central station.  \n4. A control single\u2010photon source S_C prepares a flying photonic qubit in |+\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

[anc. det.] are ancillary detectors, which should be measured by a third party.\\n\\nThe setup to create a 3d Bell state setup would normally be easier to realize, but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping. This means, that [0] should be measured by Alice, [1] should be measured by Bob and the ancillary detectors should be measured by Charlie.\\n\\nThere should be no emitter that can send a photon to both Alice and Bob. We choose that there are three emitters that can send photons to Bob and Charlie ([2],[3],[4]) and three emitters that can send photons to Alice and Charlie ([5],[6],[7]).\\n\\nIn the context of single photon emitters, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes paths between the specified pairs of source and detector.\\nWe thus include all of these forbidden paths.\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party.\\n\\nThe standard entanglement swapping experiment uses probabilistic photon pair sources whereas this uses single photon sources.\\n\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two qutrits with single photon sources', 'foldername': 'ES3d_sp', 'bulk_thr': 0.0, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-09, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 10, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['00', '11', '22'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 5], [1, 6], [1, 7]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

Of our brainstorms, the most novel is to place two teleportation channels (A\u2192B and B\u2192A) in an indefinite causal order via a flying control photon. Pytheus can optimize a static interferometer mixing the control qubit with the four Bell\u2010measurement photons, with no active switching or feedback.

Node B: unknown qubit state \u2223\u03c6\u27e9_B is transduced by single\u2010photon source S_B.  \n3. Each node hosts a Bell\u2010pair source P_A at A and P_B at B. One photon of each pair remains stored locally as the memory; the other (idler) travels to the central station.  \n4. A control single\u2010photon source S_C prepares |+\u27e9=(|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2. Depending on its spatial mode, the interferometer enacts either the A-then-B teleportation sequence or the B-then-A sequence.  \n5.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

This realizes indefinite causal order of two teleportation operations in one static linear\u2010optics network.\nStep 2: Compare/obstacles:\n  a) Already known multi\u2010swap examples.\n  b) Similar to earlier \u201crouter\u201d proposals.\n  c) Novel network primitive (quantum SWITCH) on teleportation channels; Pytheus can optimize a fixed multiport interferometer to enact a control\u2010qubit\u2013dependent mixing of two Bell\u2010measurements, with no dynamic feedback.\nStep 3: Choose (c).\nStep 4: Novelty: It is the first Pytheus\u2010style experiment to implement a quantum SWITCH of two teleportation channels between remote superconducting nodes, creating an indefinite causal order of network operations rather than a fixed swap or router.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Only single\u2010photon (transducer) sources, two probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, one single\u2010photon control source, a static 5-input linear\u2010optics interferometer, and 5 photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

Two local Bell\u2010pair sources P_A at A and P_B at B each emit a photon pair: one photon stays as the memory at the originating node; the idler photons P_Aid and P_Bid travel to the central station.  \n4. A control single\u2010photon source S_C prepares a flying photonic qubit in |+\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2.

All five flying photons (S_C, S_A, S_B, P_Aid, P_Bid) enter a fixed 5-port linear\u2010optics network of beam splitters and phase shifters. Five photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors D0\u2026D4 record click patterns.  \n6.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

(Too close to textbook teleportation.)\n    b) A repeater segment: two entanglement\u2010swapping stations between three superconducting nodes.

Pytheus can optimize a fixed multiport interferometer plus detectors; no feedback required.  \n  Step 3: Pick (c), the teleportation router.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it realizes a new quantum\u2010network primitive\u2014measurement\u2010induced routing of a quantum state to one of multiple solid\u2010state nodes\u2014using transduction plus linear optics, without dynamic switches.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it only uses single\u2010photon sources (the two transducers and two Bell\u2010pair sources), a static multiport interferometer, and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors; no cavities or feedback.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nExplanation:\nWe propose a \u201cquantum teleportation router\u201d linking three superconducting\u2010qubit nodes (A, B, C) via quantum transduction and a single linear\u2010optics measurement. An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer.

    "output": "Explanation:\nWe propose to implement an \u201cindefinite\u2010order teleportation\u201d channel (the quantum SWITCH of two teleportation links) between two remote superconducting\u2010qubit nodes A and B, using quantum transduction into flying photons and one static linear\u2010optics station. A control photonic qubit coherently superposes the order in which the teleportation A\u2192B or B\u2192A takes place\u2014no dynamic switches or feedback loops, only post\u2010selected heralding.\n\nProtocol outline:\n1. Node A\u2019s unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 is mapped by a quantum transducer (single\u2010photon source S_A) into a photonic qubit.  \n2. Node B\u2019s unknown qubit \u2223\u03d5\u27e9_b is similarly transduced via S_B.  \n3. Each node hosts a Bell\u2010pair source (probabilistic photon\u2010pair source P_A at A, P_B at B). One photon of each pair remains stored locally as the memory; the other (\u201cidler\u201d) is sent to the central station.  \n4. A control photon in state |+\u27e9=(|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 from source S_C enters alongside the four \u201cteleportation\u201d photons. Depending on its spatial mode, the static interferometer implements either the sequence (A\u2010then\u2010B teleportation) or (B\u2010then\u2010A).  \n5. All five flying photons (control, S_A, S_B, P_A\u2010idler, P_B\u2010idler) pass through a fixed five\u2010port beam\u2010splitter + phase\u2010shifter network. Five photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors record which two detectors click.  \n6. Two distinct click\u2013patterns herald success:  \n   \u2022 D0+D1 clicks \u21d2 \u201cA\u2192B then B\u2192A\u201d executed; memories hold \u2223\u03d5\u27e9 at A and \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 at B.  \n   \u2022 D2+D3 clicks \u21d2 \u201cB\u2192A then A\u2192B\u201d; memories likewise updated but in the opposite order.  \nBecause the control photon was |+\u27e9, the entire operation is a coherent superposition of both causal orders. Classical Pauli corrections (outside Pytheus) complete each teleportation.\n\nGeneralizations:\n\u2022 Extend to N\u2010link SWITCHes by adding N Bell sources and enlarging the interferometer.  \n\u2022 Embed higher\u2010dimensional control qudits to superpose richer network\u2010operation sequences.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{\n  'description': 'Indefinite\u2010order teleportation channel (quantum\u2010SWITCH) between superconducting nodes A\u2194B via transduction & LOQC',\n  'foldername': 'TeleportQSwitch',\n  'single_emitters': [0,1,2],       # 0=S_C (control), 1=S_A (\u03c8), 2=S_B (\u03d5)\n  'pair_sources':    [3,4],          # 3=P_A idler, 4=P_B idler\n  'num_anc':         5,              # five photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors\n  'in_nodes':        [0,1,2,5,6],     # flying: control(0), \u03c8(1), \u03d5(2), P_A-idler(5), P_B-idler(6)\n  'heralding_out':   [0,1,2,3,4],     # detectors D0\u2026D4\n  'out_nodes':       [],             # memories (signal photons) at A & B are offline\n  'target_quantum':  ['11000','00110'],  \n     # '11000' = D0&D1 click \u21d2 A\u2192B then B\u2192A  \n     # '00110' = D2&D3 click \u21d2 B\u2192A then A\u2192B\n  'removed_connections': [],         # all sources may connect to all detectors\n  'thresholds':       [0.3,0.1],\n  'optimizer':        'L-BFGS-B',\n  'loss_func':        'cr',\n  'samples':          20,\n  'number_resolving': True\n}\n\nWhy this is novel:\n\u2013 Implements a genuinely new network primitive\u2014the quantum\u2010SWITCH of two teleportation channels\u2014rather than mere pairwise entanglement swapping or fixed\u2010order teleportation.  \n\u2013 Combines superconducting\u2010qubit transduction with linear\u2010optics measurements in a static interferometer to achieve indefinite causal order.\n\nWhy this is Pytheus\u2010feasible:\n\u2013 Uses only single\u2010photon and probabilistic pair sources plus beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n\u2013 No cavities, resonators, dynamic feedback, or active switching elements are required, fitting exactly within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities."

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

Of our brainstorms, the most novel is to place two teleportation channels (A\u2192B and B\u2192A) in an indefinite causal order via a flying control photon. Pytheus can optimize a static interferometer mixing the control qubit with the four Bell\u2010measurement photons, with no active switching or feedback.

A flying control photonic qubit coherently superposes the order in which the teleportation A\u2192B and B\u2192A occur\u2014no dynamic elements, only post\u2010selected heralding.\n\nProtocol outline:\n1. Node A: unknown qubit state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9_A is transduced into a photonic qubit by single\u2010photon source S_A.  \n2. Node B: unknown qubit state \u2223\u03c6\u27e9_B is transduced by single\u2010photon source S_B.  \n3. Each node hosts a Bell\u2010pair source P_A at A and P_B at B. One photon of each pair remains stored locally as the memory; the other (idler) travels to the central station.  \n4. A control single\u2010photon source S_C prepares |+\u27e9=(|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2. Depending on its spatial mode, the interferometer enacts either the A-then-B teleportation sequence or the B-then-A sequence.  \n5.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3).

This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network. Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors record one of two distinct heralding patterns\u2014pattern P_B heralds teleportation of \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 onto B\u2019s retained photon, pattern P_C heralds teleportation onto C\u2019s retained photon.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposal is essentially the standard quantum teleportation primitive\u2014using one Bell pair and a Bell-state measurement\u2014to transfer an arbitrary qubit state, here simply extended via a quantum transducer to superconducting qubits. While interfacing superconducting and photonic platforms is technologically important, the linear\u2010optical network itself remains the classic teleportation scheme with nothing fundamentally new in the measurement or network topology. This does not meet our bar for a novel PRL\u2010worthy quantum\u2010optics experiment.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

Instead of simply teleporting a state or swapping entanglement, we show how a *photonic program qubit* can select in superposition which of two different two-qubit gates is applied *remotely* between two superconducting nodes, all in one static LOQC station.  \n\nExplanation:  \n1) Node A holds an unknown superconducting qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2081, Node B holds \u2223\u03c6\u27e9\u2082.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

An unknown qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 stored in A is first transduced into a single photon (source S_A).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-qubit CZ gates robust against charge noise in silicon while\n  compensating for crosstalk using neural network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Calibration-Independent Certification of a Quantum Frequency Converter\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: State polynomials: positivity, optimization and nonlinear Bell\n  inequalities\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Node A houses a superconducting qubit whose state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 (unknown superposition of \u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9) is transduced into a photonic qubit (time\u2010bin or dual\u2010rail) via a quantum transducer.  \n2. Node B also has a transducer coupled to a superconducting qubit initially prepared in one arm of an optical Bell pair; the other photon of that pair will later be used in the Bell measurement.  \n3. The flying photonic qubit from A and one photon of the Bell pair from B are routed to a central linear\u2010optics station, where a Bell\u2010state analyzer (beam splitters + photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors) performs a joint measurement. Two ancillary detectors register a successful Bell outcome.  \n4. Upon heralding, classical feed\u2010forward (outside Pytheus\u2019s scope) directs a Pauli correction on superconducting qubit B, completing teleportation.  \n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\nsources: [S_trans_A] [S_Bell1] [S_Bell2]  \noptical network: [beam splitters, phase shifters]  \ndetectors: [ancilla1][ancilla2] [out_\u03c8]  \n\nHere [out_\u03c8] feeds the teleported qubit back into superconducting qubit B (via its transducer in reverse).  \n\nGeneralization:  \n\u2022 Extend to repeater chains by adding intermediate transducers and swapping stations between nodes.  \n\u2022 Replace the two-photon Bell pair source at B with a scalable multi-photon resource for cluster-state\u2013based teleportation.  \n\nPytheus\u2010style Config Skeleton:\n{'description': 'Teleportation between superconducting qubits via quantum transduction and linear\u2010optics Bell measurement',  \n 'foldername': 'TransducerTeleport',  \n 'num_anc': 2,  \n 'in_nodes': [0,1],        # 0=transduced \u03c8 from A, 1=one photon of Bell pair from B  \n 'out_nodes': [2],         # teleported \u03c8 arrives here  \n 'target_quantum': ['00','11'],  # perfect correlation between input bit and output bit  \n 'removed_connections': [[0,2]], # no direct source\u2010to\u2010output link  \n 'thresholds': [0.3,0.1],  \n 'samples': 20,  \n 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func': 'cr',  \n 'number_resolving': True,  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1], # treat both transduced qubit and Bell\u2010pair photon as single\u2010photon sources  \n}  \n\nNo cavities, no feedback loops in Pytheus; only linear optics, probabilistic sources, and photon detection.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The idea must go beyond straightforward teleportation; you need to introduce a genuinely new network primitive or measurement that isn\u2019t already just the standard Bell\u2010swap/teleport protocol.

An unknown qubit \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 on A is mapped to a photonic qubit via its transducer (source S_A). Two independent Bell\u2010pair sources at B and C emit optical Bell pairs (S_B and S_C). Half of each Bell pair remains at the respective node as the target memory; the other halves are sent to a central multiport interferometer. In that interferometer the photon from A and the two \u201cflying\u201d Bell photons are mixed in a fixed three\u2010input linear\u2010optics network.

    "output": "Here is a genuinely new **network-transformation** primitive that combines superconducting qubit transduction with purely linear-optical post-selection and realizes an **indefinite causal-order teleportation channel** between two remote solid-state nodes.\n\nExplanation:\nWe implement **two teleportation channels** (A\u2192B and B\u2192A) whose order is placed in coherent superposition by a flying photonic control qubit.  In one run, A\u2019s unknown \u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 and B\u2019s unknown \u2223\u03d5\u27e9_\ud835\udc4f are simultaneously teleported into each other\u2019s memories, but **without a fixed \u201cfirst\u2010then\u2010second\u201d order**.  Instead, a control photon \u2223+\u27e9\u2006=\u2006(|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 coherently routes which Bell measurement happens \u201cfirst\u201d vs \u201csecond,\u201d embedding an **indefinite causal structure** into the network.\n\nProtocol outline:\n1. Nodes A and B each have  \n   \u2022 a superconducting qubit in an unknown state (\u2223\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at A, \u2223\u03d5\u27e9_\ud835\udc4f at B),  \n   \u2022 a transducer mapping that qubit onto a single photonic qubit (sources S_A and S_B).  \n2. Each node also holds a local Bell-pair source (P_A at A, P_B at B).  One photon of each pair remains as the **memory** (the eventual teleported state) at the originating node; the idler photon is sent to the central LOQC station.  \n3. A **control** single-photon source S_C emits \u2223+\u27e9 into two spatial modes.  Spatial-mode \u201c0\u201d drives the interferometer to perform the A\u2192B teleportation measurement first and then B\u2192A; mode \u201c1\u201d drives it to perform B\u2192A first and then A\u2192B.  \n4. All **five** flying photons (S_C, S_A, S_B, P_A-idler, P_B-idler) enter a **fixed** five-port linear-optics network (beam splitters + phase shifters).  \n5. Five photon-number-resolving detectors D0\u2026D4 record a **two-click herald pattern**:  \n   \u2022 clicks at (D0,D1) \u21d2 \u201cA\u2192B then B\u2192A\u201d was enacted,  \n   \u2022 clicks at (D2,D3) \u21d2 \u201cB\u2192A then A\u2192B.\u201d  \n   Because S_C started in |+\u27e9, the post-selected process is the **coherent superposition** of both orders\u2014an **indefinite causal order** of two teleportation channels.  \n6. After heralding, classical feed-forward applies the appropriate Pauli corrections on the stored Bell-pair photons at A and B, completing both teleports.\n\nGeneralizations:\n\u2022 Extend to N channels under indefinite order by adding more Bell sources and enlarging to a (2N+1)-port interferometer.  \n\u2022 Explore superpositions of more complex network-tasks (e.g. swap vs teleport vs entanglement-swap) by routing multiple control modes.  \n\nPytheus-style Config Skeleton:  \n{'description': 'Quantum\u2010SWITCH of teleportation channels A\u2194B via flying control qubit and LOQC',  \n 'foldername': 'IndefiniteOrderTeleport',  \n 'single_emitters': [0,1,2],       # 0=S_C (control), 1=S_A (\u03c8), 2=S_B (\u03d5)  \n 'pair_sources':    [3,4],         # 3=P_A, 4=P_B  \n 'num_anc':         5,             # detectors D0\u2026D4  \n 'in_nodes':        [0,1,2,5,6],    # 0=control, 1=\u03c8, 2=\u03d5, 5=P_A-idler, 6=P_B-idler  \n 'heralding_out':   [0,1,2,3,4],    # detectors monitor herald clicks  \n 'out_nodes':       [],            # memories are the partner photons at A & B  \n 'target_quantum':  ['11000','00110'],  \n   # '11000' = D0&D1 click \u21d2 A\u2192B then B\u2192A  \n   # '00110' = D2&D3 click \u21d2 B\u2192A then A\u2192B  \n 'removed_connections': [],        # full connectivity in the LOQC network  \n 'thresholds':      [0.3,0.1],  \n 'optimizer':       'L-BFGS-B',  \n 'loss_func':       'cr',  \n 'samples':         20,  \n 'number_resolving': True  \n}  \n\nWhy it\u2019s novel:\n\u2013 Implements an **indefinite causal-order** of two teleportation operations between superconducting qubits\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment has ever done this.  \n\u2013 Merges **quantum transducers** with a **static** LOQC network and post-selection to realize a new high-level network primitive (a teleportation SW-ITCH) rather than mere entanglement swapping or routing.\n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible:\n\u2013 Pytheus can handle up to five single-photon and Bell-pair sources, optimize the multiport beam-splitter network, and assign detectors for heralding patterns.  \n\u2013 No cavities or real-time feedback loops appear\u2014the entire protocol is **post-selected** on two-click patterns in a fixed interferometer, which is exactly Pytheus\u2019s sweet spot.\n\nThis experiment would open the door to **superconducting-quantum-circuit networks** with **indefinite causal structure**, a frontier for both foundational tests and novel quantum communication protocols."
