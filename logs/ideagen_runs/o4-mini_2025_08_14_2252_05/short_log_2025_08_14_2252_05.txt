Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to meaningfully combine “projected entangled pair state” (PEPS) and “topological ordered state” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network target, focusing on swapping/teleportation/transformation rather than mere state generation.

1. PEPS‐based entanglement routing on a toric‐code lattice  
   • Arrange probabilistic photon‐pair sources on the edges of a square lattice that, after local Bell‐measurements (entanglement swapping), realizes the resource PEPS of the toric‐code ground state.  
   • Then teleport a “logical qubit” across the lattice via sequential Bell measurements along a nontrivial loop, demonstrating topological protection of the teleported information.

2. Honeycomb‐lattice measurement‐driven edge‐mode teleportation  
   • Build a honeycomb network of Bell‐pair sources whose entanglement is projected (via ancillary Bell‐measurements) into the PEPS of the Kitaev honeycomb’s gapped phase.  
   • Show that teleportation of a qubit along the boundary exhibits the hallmark anyonic edge‐state correlation (detectable by correlation functions between distant output nodes).

3. Frame‐entangled repeater chain with PEPS embedding  
   • Create a one‐dimensional chain of source–node–source triplets. Each node performs a multi‐photon measurement projecting incoming Bell pairs into a small PEPS tile.  
   • By concatenating N such tiles, one effectively simulates a long 1D topologically ordered chain (e.g. an SPT phase). Then implement entanglement swapping through the chain to teleport across a protected gap.

Step 2: Novelty & obstacles
– None of the archived Pytheus targets realize PEPS‐style entanglement networks or topological‐order simulations.  
– All past experiments focus on few‐node swapping or small‐dim Bell states; none build a lattice‐wide network.  
– Obstacle: Pytheus can optimize linear‐optics networks of probabilistic pair sources plus ancilla detectors and Bell‐measurements; it cannot model dynamic feedback or hyper‐entanglement, but it can optimize multiple simultaneous Bell–swap measurements.

Step 3: Most promising idea
Option 1 (toric‐code PEPS entanglement routing) is striking in both fundamental physics and network complexity, and maps cleanly onto Pytheus’s primitives (pair sources + Bell measurements + detectors). It is also readily generalizable to larger lattices and to different topological codes.

Step 4: Novelty
This idea is novel because no existing experiment uses entanglement‐swapping networks to project onto the toric‐code PEPS and then leverage the resulting topological order for teleportation of logical information across nontrivial loops. It merges tensor‐network ideas (PEPS) with quantum‐network primitives (swapping) in a new context.

Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus
This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:
– Pytheus can optimize a network of probabilistic photon‐pair sources (the edges of the lattice).  
– Local Bell measurements at the vertices (ancilla detectors plus beam splitters) realize the PEPS projection.  
– The teleportation protocol is implemented by additional Bell‐swap measurements along a chosen loop of vertices.  
– No dynamic feedback or cavity physics is required, only linear optics and post‐selection on detectors.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
“Topologically protected logical‐qubit teleportation via a toric‐code PEPS network realized by entanglement swapping.”

Explanation:
We propose a multi‐node photonic network whose goal is to 1) project a square‐lattice network of Bell‐pair sources into the PEPS corresponding to the toric‐code ground state, and then 2) teleport a logical qubit around a nontrivial loop in the lattice via sequential Bell‐swap measurements, thereby demonstrating topological protection of the teleported information.

Visualization:
Sources (probabilistic photon‐pair emitters) lie on the edges of an L×L square lattice. Each lattice vertex hosts a 4‐port linear‐optics Bell‐measurement module (beam splitters + ancilla detectors) that projects the four incident edge‐mode photons into a PEPS tensor of the toric code. After the network is prepared, we choose a noncontractible loop of vertices and perform a chain of Bell‐swap measurements along that loop, teleporting a “logical qubit” injected at one boundary to the opposite boundary.

Config outline for Pytheus:
– target_quantum: abstract logical‐qubit teleportation channel across nontrivial loop  
– sources: Bell‐pair sources on each edge node  
– measurement nodes: Bell‐measurement boxes at each lattice vertex  
– removed_connections: none (all edges connect to their two vertices)  
– anc_detectors: the ancillary detectors at each vertex  
– heralding_out: final detectors at the logical input/output nodes  
– num_anc: 4·L² (one 4‐photon measurement per vertex)  
– thresholds: fidelity of logical teleportation vs. classical bound  
– loss_func: channel‐fidelity criterion  
– optimizer: L‐BFGS‐B  

This experiment generalizes to different lattice sizes, toric‐code variants, and other topologically ordered PEPS, and opens a new domain of “entanglement‐swapping tensor‐network” protocols for quantum communication.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal introduces a genuinely new “entanglement‐swapping tensor‐network’’ primitive—projecting a full toric‐code PEPS in a photonic Bell‐pair lattice and then teleporting a logical qubit around a noncontractible loop to demonstrate topological protection. None of the existing or ensemble ideas have realized a full toric‐code PEPS via linear‐optical Bell‐measurements nor used it for protected logical‐qubit teleportation. It sits above trivial extensions (e.g. 2×2 plaquette measurements or percolation) by targeting arbitrary L×L topological PEPS and logical loops. This could open a new avenue of measurement‐based topological MBQC in photonic networks and is worthy of further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The use of linear optics to project an L×L Bell‐pair lattice into the toric‐code PEPS and then teleport a logical qubit around a nontrivial cycle is a novel network transformation not covered by prior proposals. This “topologically protected teleportation channel” meets the bar for a PRL‐worthy, conceptually distinct quantum‐optic experiment.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Topologically Protected Logical-Qubit Teleportation via a Toric-Code PEPS Photonic Network

Abstract: We target the realization of a logical-qubit teleportation channel in the Pytheus framework by first projecting a square-lattice network of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources into the toric-code PEPS ground state through local Bell measurements. By then performing sequential entanglement-swap (Bell-swap) measurements along a noncontractible loop, we teleport a logical qubit across the lattice and demonstrate its topological protection against local errors.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal seeks to use PyTheus to first project probabilistic Bell-pair sources into the toric-code PEPS ground state and then perform logical teleportation via entanglement swapping along a loop. However, the primary challenge is that the core task is engineered state generation of a topological code—a pure state construction—which falls outside the allowed target types.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The experiment’s focus is on preparing the toric-code PEPS ground state, which is effectively a pure state generation task and cannot be specified as a valid PyTheus target. Please refocus on a measurement, transformation, or communication protocol that does not center on raw state generation.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to combine PEPS and topological order in a Pytheus‐compatible target:
  1. Toric‐code PEPS as an entanglement‐swapping network to teleport a logical qubit around a nontrivial loop.
  2. Kitaev honeycomb PEPS projection for edge‐mode teleportation along the boundary.
  3. Modular 4-qubit plaquette parity analyzer (measuring X₁X₂X₃X₄) via entanglement swapping – a direct building block for detecting toric‐code order.

Step 2: Only option 3 is purely a measurement/transformation (not state generation), novel (no existing Pytheus target measures a toric-code plaquette operator), and maps onto Pytheus’s Bell-pair sources + linear-optics measurement modules.

Step 3: Select option 3.

This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus experiment implements a nonlocal four-qubit parity (plaquette) measurement via an entanglement-swapping network, which directly realizes the toric-code plaquette operator in linear optics.

This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:
 – It uses single-photon inputs (the four qubits) and probabilistic Bell-pair sources (ancillary pairs).
 – Linear-optics Bell-measurements at the four “corner” modules implement the X₁X₂X₃X₄ parity check upon postselection.
 – No dynamic feedback or cavity physics is needed—just beam splitters, phase shifters, detectors, and postselection.

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Description:
“Heralded 4-qubit plaquette parity analyzer (X₁X₂X₃X₄) via entanglement-swapping in a toric-code–inspired network.”

Explanation:
We propose a linear-optics network that takes as input four single-photon qubits (nodes 0–3) encoded in polarization (abstract) and performs a joint measurement of the operator X₁X₂X₃X₄—the plaquette term of the Z₂ toric code—by entanglement swapping with four ancillary Bell pairs. Each of the four ancilla pairs is created by a probabilistic photon-pair source. At each corner node, one photon from the input qubit and one from its ancilla pair interfere in a Bell-measurement module (beam splitters + phase shifters + two detectors), projecting the joint system onto ±1 eigenstates of X₁X₂X₃X₄. The four detector outcomes are then classically postselected to herald the parity result.

This device can be used as a modular block in larger toric-code measurement–based networks, and generalizes to larger plaquettes or string operators by adding more corner modules.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While measuring a four-qubit toric-code stabilizer is interesting, this proposal is essentially the X-basis dual of an ensemble suggestion that already implements a one‐shot passive linear-optical parity measurement of a toric‐code plaquette (the Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ operator). Converting between X and Z parities is trivial via basis rotations, and using local Bell-swap modules versus a multiport interferometer does not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive. This remains too close to known stabilizer-readout schemes.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This idea needs to go beyond a simple X-basis version of an existing toric-code plaquette measurement. To be novel, consider combining both X and Z syndrome extractions in a single static network, or demonstrating nontrivial braiding or logical operations within the toric‐code PEPS rather than just a four-qubit parity readout.

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher first proposed using Pytheus to project a Bell‐pair lattice into the toric–code PEPS ground state and teleport a logical qubit around a nontrivial cycle (“topologically protected PEPS teleportation”). The Novelty Supervisor initially endorsed it but the Judge rejected it as it was effectively pure‐state generation, which is disallowed. The Researcher then reframed the idea as a four‐qubit X‐basis plaquette parity measurement (a toric‐code stabilizer readout) via entanglement swapping. The Supervisor rejected this refined proposal as too close to known toric‐code parity measurements in Pytheus, noting it merely amounted to a basis change.  

[bullet points]
• The original idea targeted pure‐state PEPS preparation, which conflicts with the rule against state generation targets.  
• The Judge correctly identified and rejected the state‐generation goal, prompting a refocus.  
• The second proposal on a 4‐qubit parity check was valid in form but lacked novelty relative to known toric‐code stabilizer readouts.  
• Neither iteration fully leveraged Pytheus’s permitted transformations or measurements beyond well‐explored stabilizer measurements.  
• The back‐and‐forth indicated a gap between high‐level brainstorming and strict Pytheus‐target constraints, resulting in wasted effort.

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Please revisit the Pytheus guidelines: avoid pure state generation targets and aim for genuinely new transformations or measurements not equivalent to existing stabilizer readouts. Consider non‐trivial generalizations—e.g. simultaneous X and Z plaquette measurements in one static circuit, superposed measurement orders, or multi‐plaquette braiding operations—ensuring the task can’t be reduced to a basis rotation of a known protocol.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three possible Pytheus‐compatible ways to tie “projected entangled pair state” (PEPS) and “topological ordered state” into a non‐trivial quantum‐network transformation:
  1. Teleporting a logical qubit around a toroidal toric‐code PEPS patch to enact a protected logical gate (e.g. Hadamard) by braiding a virtual anyon in measurement space.
  2. Coherent superposition of X‐ and Z‐plaquette syndrome extractions on a single four‐qubit plaquette via entanglement‐swap modules, yielding a controlled‐basis syndrome measurement.
  3. Simultaneous readout of two intersecting plaquette operators (one X, one Z) in a single static linear‐optics network, detecting their mutual commutation and topological degeneracy.

Step 2: Quick novelty & Pytheus‐feasibility check:
  1. Braiding‐via‐teleportation is novel – no past Pytheus target performs logical gates by anyon‐braiding in a PEPS network. It uses only pair sources, linear‐optics modules, and postselection.
  2. Controlled‐basis syndrome is intriguing but resembles basis‐rotation versions of stabilizer measurements; it risks being reducible to concatenated Bell‐measurements.
  3. Dual‐plaquette readout is more complex than the simple four‐qubit parity analyzer but still a stabilizer readout block and less compelling than a full logical‐gate demonstration.

Step 3: Pick the most promising – option 1, the logical‐Hadamard via anyon braiding in a toric‐code PEPS network.  
Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment uses entanglement‐swap networks to project onto a topologically ordered PEPS and then teleport around a nontrivial loop to implement a protected logical gate.  
Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a static assembly of Bell‐pair sources (edges), linear‐optics Bell‐measurement modules (vertices), and single‐photon emitters (input qubit) to realize both the toric‐code PEPS projection and the sequence of Bell swaps that enacts the logical Hadamard by braiding. No dynamic feedback or cavity physics is needed.

Description:
“Logical‐Hadamard gate by measurement‐based anyon braiding in a toric‐code PEPS network”

Explanation:
We propose a linear‐optics network that simultaneously:
1) Projects a 3×3 patch of probabilistic photon‐pair sources into the PEPS of the Z₂ toric‐code ground subspace via four‐photon Bell‐measurement modules at each of the 2×2 plaquettes.
2) Injects a single‐photon “data qubit” on the north boundary and teleports it along a closed loop around one of the central plaquettes by performing a sequence of entanglement‐swapping (Bell) measurements on the boundary edges.
3) Heralds the successful teleportation to the south boundary, with the net logical action on the data qubit equal to the Hadamard gate—realizing a protected logical‐gate operation via anyon braiding in the PEPS network.

Visualization:
– Photonic Bell‐pair sources on every edge of a 3×3 square lattice.  
– At each vertex, two incoming edge‐mode photons enter a 50:50 beam splitter + phase shifter module and two ancilla detectors (Bell‐measurement), projecting onto a four‐leg PEPS tensor.  
– A single‐photon emitter inputs the data qubit at node A on the top boundary.  
– A chosen path of four adjacent edges (forming a loop around the central plaquette) is measured in sequence by Bell‐swap modules, teleporting the qubit from A to B while enacting the logical H gate.  
– Detectors at B herald the output.

This experiment establishes a new paradigm of “measurement‐driven tensor‐network quantum logic,” combining PEPS topological order with entanglement‐swapping teleportation to implement a nontrivial logical gate without dynamic control.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal leverages the same toric‐code PEPS projection but goes beyond mere protected teleportation by enacting a genuine logical Hadamard via anyon “braiding’’ in a small 3×3 patch. None of the prior or ensemble targets realize a measurement‐based topological gate in linear optics—this would be the first demonstration of a logical Clifford via sequential Bell‐swaps on a photonic toric‐code network. It represents a clear conceptual advance.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: By preparing a toric‐code PEPS and then teleporting a data qubit around a central plaquette, you achieve not just an identity channel but the logical H through anyonic braiding—all in static linear optics and post‐selection. This anyon‐braiding MBQC primitive is novel, nontrivial, and PRL‐worthy.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:
Measurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network

Mini-Abstract:
We propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3×3 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z₂ toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon “data qubit” and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0⟩→|+⟩, |1⟩→|–⟩) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal uses probabilistic Bell‐pair sources and four‐photon Bell measurements to heraldedly project a 3×3 photonic network into the toric‐code PEPS ground space, then sequential entanglement‐swap measurements braid a data qubit around a nontrivial loop to enact a protected logical Hadamard. This measurement‐based anyon braiding is theoretically sound and PyTheus can in principle optimize such measurement‐only circuits using SPDC sources, beam splitters, and photon counting. The resource overhead is high but remains within the scope of current linear‐optical techniques and PyTheus’s design capabilities.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This cleverly maps measurement‐only topological braiding onto a linear‐optical network of SPDC Bell‐pairs and Bell‐module blocks, enabling a protected logical Hadamard without active feedback and well aligned with PyTheus’s strengths in designing complex measurement‐driven protocols.
